abstract = {An assessment of sea intrusion into coastal aquifers as a consequence of local sea-level rise (LSLR) due to climate change was carried out at Murgia and Salento in southern Italy. The interpolation of sea-level measurements at three tide-gauge stations was performed during the period of 2000 to 2014. The best fit of measurements shows an increasing rate of LSLR ranging from 4.4 mm/y to 8.8 mm/y, which will result in a maximum LSLR of approximately 2 m during the 22nd century. The local rate of sea-level rise matches recent 21st and 22nd century projections of mean global sea-level rise determined by other researchers, which include increased melting rates of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, the effect of ocean thermal expansion, the melting of glaciers and ice caps, and changes in the quantity of stored land water. Subsequently, Ghyben-Herzberg's equation for the freshwater/saltwater interface was rewritten in order to determine the decrease in groundwater discharge due to the maximum LSLR. Groundwater flow simulations and ArcGIS elaborations of digital elevation models of the coast provided input data for the Ghyben-Herzberg calculation under the assumption of head-controlled systems. The progression of seawater intrusion due to LSLR suggests an impressive depletion of available groundwater discharge during the 22nd century, perhaps as much as 16.1{\%} of current groundwater pumping for potable water in Salento.},

abstract = {An accurate and complete emission inventory for atmospheric trace metals on a global scale is needed for both modeler community and policy makers to assess the current level of environmental contamination by these pollutants, major emission sources and source regions, and the contribution of the atmospheric pathway to the contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments. Major progress has been made in assessing emissions of trace metals in various countries and even regions, e.g., Europe, since the first global emission estimate for these pollutants was made by Nriagu and Pacyna (1988). These improved national and regional emission inventories have been used in this work to assess the global trace metal emissions from anthropogenic sources in the mid-1990s. The results of this work conclude that stationary fossil fuel combustion continues to be the major source of Cr, Hg, Mn, Sb, Se, Sn, and Tl with respect to the coal combustion and the major source of Ni and V with respect to oil combustion. Combustion of leaded, low-leaded, and unleaded gasoline continues to be the major source of atmospheric Pb emissions. The third major source of trace metals is non-ferrous metal production, which is the largest source of atmospheric As, Cd, Cu, In, and Zn. The largest anthropogenic emissions of atmospheric trace metals were estimated in Asia. This can be explained by growing demands for energy in the region and increasing industrial production. As a result, the Asian emissions are not only larger than the emissions on other continents, but also show an increasing trend. Another factor contributing to high emissions in Asia is the efficiency of emission control, which is lower than in Europe and North America. Concerning the two latter continents, emissions of trace metals show a decreasing tendency over the last two decades.},

abstract = {In the coming decades, fishery resource managers and policy-makers in Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) will be increasingly challenged by the need to ensure food security in the context of a changing climate, increasing human pressure on the marine environment, and limited understanding of marine ecosystems and associated resources. These decision-makers must address a pressing and overarching question – how will pelagic resources and pressures on such resources change over time and space? Answering this question requires ongoing inquiry into critical dimensions of pelagic species and systems, for both the commercial tuna species that are managed by Regional Fishery Management Organizations (RFMOs), as well as nearshore pelagic fishes that support many small-scale fisheries and are managed at national and local levels. Research priorities include generating further insight into life history and physiology, oceanographic context, movement and migration, food webs, ecosystem dynamics and stock status. Concurrently, socioeconomic research is needed to tailor fisheries management strategies to local, national and regional conditions; and improve understanding of incentive structures among players in RFMOs such as the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission. PICT-based scientists and managers are ideally situated to generate new fisheries-relevant data; however, investments are needed to expand the capacity for research, management, and sustainable fisheries development within PICTs. Such capacity building can be accelerated through collaboration between PICTs, RFMOs, and scientific centers of excellence in Distant Water Fishing Nations. Without increased capacity development, this region will be adversely affected by the impacts of climate change and less able to take advantage of opportunities for economic development.},

abstract = {This study examines Fe-Mn crusts that form on seamounts along the California continental-margin (CCM), within the United States 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. The study area extends from approximately 30° to 38° North latitudes and from 117° to 126° West longitudes. The area of study is a tectonically active northeast Pacific plate boundary region and is also part of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre with currents dominated by the California Current System. Upwelling of nutrient-rich water results in high primary productivity that produces a pronounced oxygen minimum zone. Hydrogenetic Fe-Mn crusts forming along the CCM show distinct chemical and mineral compositions compared to open-ocean crusts. On average, CCM crusts contain more Fe relative to Mn than open-ocean Pacific crusts. The continental shelf and slope release both Fe and Mn under low-oxygen conditions. Silica is also enriched relative to Al compared to open-ocean crusts. This is due to the North Pacific silica plume and enrichment of Si along the path of deep-water circulation, resulting in Si enrichment in bottom and intermediate waters of the eastern Pacific. The CCM Fe-Mn crusts have a higher percentage of birnessite than open-ocean crusts, reflecting lower dissolved seawater oxygen that results from the intense coastal upwelling and proximity to zones of continental slope pore-water anoxia. Carbonate fluorapatite (CFA) is not present and CCM crusts do not show evidence of phosphatization, even in the older sections. The mineralogy indicates a suboxic environment under which birnessite forms, but in which pH is not high enough to facilitate CFA deposition. Growth rates of CCM crusts generally increase with increasing water depth, likely due to deep-water Fe sources mobilized from reduced shelf and slope sediments. Many elements of economic interest including Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, W, and Te have slightly or significantly lower concentrations in CCM crusts relative to crusts from the Pacific Prime Crust Zone and other open-ocean basins. However, concentrations of total rare earth elements and yttrium average only slightly lower contents and in the future may be a strategic resource for the U.S.},

abstract = {In high nitrate low chlorophyll (HNLC) oceanic regions, trace metals play a key role in regulating phytoplankton productivity; however large knowledge gaps remain in the biogeochecmical cycling of trace metals in these areas. Here I present the first comprehensive winter dataset (0-1000 m depth) for dissolved zinc, cadmium, copper, nickel, cobalt, and lead along with the macronutrinets phosphate and silicon, between 40°S-52°S, which traverses the Subantarctic zone (SAZ), east of Australia. Dissolved lead concentrations were conservative with depth with values ranging between 12 and 33 pmol kg- 1. Surface dissolved concentrations for cadmium, copper, nickel, cobalt and phosphate showed large north-south gradients, with lower concentrations at the Subtropical Front (∼ 43°S) and higher concentrations at the Subantarctic Front (∼ 51°S). Profiles of dissolved cadmium, copper, nickel and cobalt concentration increased with depth in a manner similar to that of phosphate. Dissolved cadmium was strongly correlated to phosphate at concentrations greater than 0.74 $\mu$mol kg- 1; below this concentration cadmium was depleted ({\textless} 40 pmol kg- 1). The depletion of cadmium before that of phosphate is consistent with the hypothesis that the 'kink' in the cadmium-phosphate relationship is linked to iron limitation in Southern Ocean waters. For zinc and silicon, surface dissolved concentrations were low across the transect. Profiles of dissolved zinc and silicon concentration increased with depth and were similar in nature, indicating a close coupling between these two elements. The coupling of zinc and silicon implies that diatoms may control the global zinc-silicon relationship. These results also suggest that mode water and intermediate waters, which are important conduits for the export of silicon depleted waters to low latitudes, play major roles in regulating the concentration of zinc in the main thermocline outside of the Southern Ocean. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In SW Sardinia syngenetic to syndiagenetic Pb-Zn ores occur in Cambrian carbonates, along the un- conformity between the Cambrian and Ordovician, in Permo-Triassic karsts and in vein-type deposits related to late Hercynian granites, which also contact-metamorphosed some Cambrian deposits. In all types of deposits the lead- isotope ratios show similarly high {\#} (=238U/2°4Pb) and high W (--232Th/2°4Pb) values indicating a crustal origin for the lead. Most of the Cambrian ores contain isotopically similar or identical leads, whereas in the younger deposits the isotope ratios vary and suggest that especially the lead of Permo-Triassic ores may consist to a large extent of remobilized Cambrian, possibly also Ordovician, ore lead plus a Hercynian component. The lead of three feldspar samples from Hercynian granites of the area also shows high/{\~{}} and W values. Two of them are similar to the ore leads from a vein-type deposit and from contact-metamorphosed deposits. The third sample from the Capo Pecora granite contains a very unradiogenic lead that closely resembles many of the presumed Cambrian-Hercynian mixtures. Therefore, the possibility cannot be dismissed that at the time the Permo- Triassic ores were formed lead sources other than the already existing ores were present with the appropriate isotopic compositions.},

abstract = {The phasing out of leaded gasoline in many countries around the world at the end of the last millennium has resulted in a complex mixture of lead sources in the atmosphere. Recent studies suggest that coal combustion has become an important source of Pb in aerosols in urban and remote areas. Here, we report lead concentration and isotopic composition for 59 coal samples representing major coal deposits worldwide in an attempt to characterize this potential source. The average concentration in these coals is 35 microg Pb g(-1), with the highest values in coals from Spain and Peru and the lowest in coals from Australia and North America. The 206Pb/207Pb isotope ratios range between 1.15 and 1.24, with less radiogenic Pb in coals from Europe and Asia compared to South and North America. Comparing the Pb isotopic signatures of coals from this and previous studies with those published for Northern and Southern Hemisphere aerosols, we hypothesize that coal combustion might now be an important Pb source in China, the eastern U.S., and to some extent, in Europe but not as yet in other regions including South Africa, South America, and western U.S. This supports the notion that "old Pb pollution" from leaded gasoline reemitted into the atmosphere or long-range transport (i.e., from China to the western U.S.) is important. Comparing the isotope ratios of the coals, the age of the deposits, and Pb isotope evolution models for the major geochemical reservoirs suggests that the PbIC in coals is strongly influenced by the depositional coal forming environment.},

abstract = {Geochemical investigations of submarine thermal fluid discharges east of Panarea Island (Aeolian Islands, southern Italy) were conducted in May and September 2008. Thereby, 6 different sites (Bottaro West, Bottaro North, Point 21, Hot Lake, Black Point and Area 26) of a submarine fumarolic field, existing at depths between 8 and 30 m, were sampled by scuba diving. Several geochemical (on-site parameters, photometry, ISE, IC, ICP-MS) and isotopic analyses ($\delta$D, $\delta$18O, $\delta$13C, $\delta$34S, 87Sr/86Sr, 3He/4He) were accomplished on water and gas samples in order to improve the understanding of the hydro-chemical processes and physico-chemical conditions which are responsible for the formation of the fluids. Seawater mixing has a strong influence on the fluid chemistry. Nevertheless, the chemical composition of the fluid samples displays large differences. By means of 87Sr/86Sr ratios and semi-numeric calculations, dilution factors were determined and the probable composition of emitting fluids without the influence of seawater was calculated. Two distinct water types were found to exist, presented by the locations Hot Lake (HL) and Black Point (BP). Reservoir temperatures of 345C and 310C were estimated by using Na/K and K/Mg geothermometers for the two water types. The substantial enrichment of many major cations and anions as well as Li, Rb, Fe, Cs, I, Ba, Zn, Pb, As (up to 10,000 times) in both fluids gives evidence of intense water-rock interactions in the reservoir. Furthermore, light $\delta$13C, $\delta$34S values and high 3He/4He ratios (R/Ra {\~{}} 4.36) of the gas samples indicate the contribution of a deep magmatic component. Variations in the chloride contents of up to 130 {\%} of normal seawater point towards phase separation processes in the underground which are responsible for the formation of the highly-saline end-members of Hot Lake and Black Point. Differences between these two water types occur with regard to the chondrite normalised REE pattern and the measured redox values among others. This points to different physico-chemical conditions, probably due to local input of magmatic gases. The investigations have shown that the hydrothermal system of Panarea is very complex with regard to different fluid sources and processes. It is characterised by features of typical hydrothermal systems but also magmatic influences.},

Minimum long-term water discharge needed to sustain halite accumulation over this timescale at SdA is 9–20 times greater than modern recharge (and double wet-climate paleorecharge) within the topographic watershed. Closing this imbalance requires sourcing water from recharge on the orogenic plateau in an area over 4 times larger than the topographic watershed. Prolonged water discharge at SdA requires long residence times, deep water tables in recharge zones coupled with persistent near-surface water tables in discharge areas, and large contributing areas characterized by strong gradients in landscape and climate resulting from plateau uplift.},

abstract = {Concentrations of the heavy metals Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were measured in sea water, suspended matter, sediments and pore water samples collected in a coastal area of the middle Tyrrhenian Sea. Concentration factors between pore water (extracted from the first centimeter of the sediments) and the overlying sea water (taken 30 cm above the sea bed) were less than 1 for Cr, Cu and Pb, 1-10 for Cd and Ni, 10-100 for Fe and Co, 100-1000 for Mn, and 1-100 for Zn. The benthic fluxes of heavy metals at the sediment-water interface were measured directly using in situ benthic chambers and calculated using Fick's first law during two experimental periods, one in 1986 and the other in 1988. The fluxes of Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn varied significantly over time; this appeared to be related to their relatively low (less-than-or-equal-to 10) concentration factors. From the benthic chamber experiments, metals with positive fluxes were in the order: Mn {\textgreater} Fe {\textgreater} Co {\textgreater} Cd, while those with negative fluxes were: Zn {\textgreater} Pb {\textgreater} Ni congruent-to Cu. Fluxes calculated using Fick's Law were: positive - Mn {\textgreater} Fe {\textgreater} Zn (or Zn {\textgreater} Fe) {\textgreater} Ni {\textgreater} Co {\textgreater} Cd, negative fluxes Pb {\textgreater} Cu {\textgreater} Cr. Measured (benthic chamber) and calculated (Fick's first law) fluxes for Co, Cd, Mn, Pb and Fe were comparable within an order of magnitude, although less agreement was found for Cu, Ni and Zn. Removal of Ni and Zn at the sediment-water interface has been proposed to explain the fact that the measured and calculated fluxes have opposite directions for these metals.},

abstract = {Short-term (timescale of hours, days and weeks) earthquake (EQ) prediction is of essential importance to mitigate EQ disasters. Short-term EQ prediction has so far been based on seismic measurements (i.e. mechanical observation of crustal movements), but it was concluded in Japan about 10 years ago that EQ prediction is impossible by means of the mechanical method. Hence, there has been an increased interest and a lot of progress in non-seismic measurement during the last decade. A new approach was developed where electromagnetic measurements provide microscopic information on the lithosphere. The present paper is intended to give a history of short-term EQ prediction, and also we hope that this paper reviews the current status of a new science field, ?seismo-electromagnetics?. We make a general review of different phenomena taking place in the lithosphere, atmosphere and the ionosphere, but we pay more attention to the subjects of our preference including lithospheric ultra low frequency (ULF) electromagnetic emissions, and seismo-ionospheric perturbations.},

@article{Alleman2001,
abstract = {Both the relatively high lead concentrations and their characteristic anthropogenic isotopic compositions attest to the widespread contamination of industrial lead in the western Equatorial and South Atlantic Ocean. Spatial gradients in those isotopic signatures evidence the conservative lateral transport of lead in oceanic water masses, while the discrete isotopic signatures in deep oceanic waters substantiate the complementary hypothesis that the release of lead from settling particles is relatively small on a decadal time-scale. Specifically, the relatively low radiogenic lead (e.g., 206Pb/207Pb = 1.148 ± 0.009) in the Lower-North Atlantic Deep Water (l-NADW) south of 10° North is primarily attributed to US industrial lead emitted in the Northern Hemisphere prior to 1965, and the more radiogenic lead (e.g., 206Pb/207Pb = 1.180 ± 0.006) in the Upper-North Atlantic Deep Water (u-NADW) is primarily attributed to subsequent industrial lead emissions in that hemisphere. In contrast, the relatively radiogenic lead (e.g., 206Pb/207Pb = 1.186 ± 0.007) in the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) seemingly reflects a mixture of natural and anthropogenic lead sources within the Southern Hemisphere; and its isotopic dissimilarity with that (e.g., 206Pb/207Pb = 1.159 ± 0.002) of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and the AABW may be due to differences in either their aeolian or water-mass inputs. {\textcopyright} 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The forecasters themselves were convinced and requested that the forecasts be discontinued. The reply read approximately like this: `The commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he needs them for planning purposes.{\&}{\#}039;” (Gardner 2010). Seismologists often encounter a similar situation when developing earthquake hazard maps, which ideally describe the level of earthquake hazards in a region and provide a scientific foundation for earthquake preparation and mitigation. However, in recent years many large and destructive earthquakes have occurred in places mapped as having relatively low hazard (Kerr 2011). A striking example is the March 2011 M 9.1 earthquake off Tohoku, Japan, which occurred in an area shown by the Japanese national earthquake hazard map as one of relatively low hazard. Figure 1, from Geller (2011), illustrates his point that ...in recent years many large and destructive earthquakes have occurred in places mapped as having relatively low hazard... The regions assessed as most dangerous are the zones of three hypothetical “scenario earthquakes” (Tokai, Tonankai, and Nankai; see map). However, since 1979, earthquakes that caused 10 or more fatalities in Japan actually occurred in places assigned a relatively low probability. This discrepancy—the latest in a string of negative results for the characteristic earthquake model and its cousin, the seismic-gap model—strongly suggests that the hazard map and the methods used to produce it are flawed and should be discarded. Similar discrepancies have occurred around the world. The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (M 7.9) in China occurred {\ldots}},

abstract = {Beaches are both sensitive and critical components of the coastal systems, as they are particularly vulnerable to environmental change (e.g., the sea level rise) and form valuable coastal ecosystems and economic resources. The objective of the present study has been to record the spatial characteristics and other attributes (e.g., topography, sediments and accessibility) of the 71 beaches of the E. Crete (Eastern Mediterranean) that are either already developed or have a reasonable development potential and assess their erosion risk under sea level rise. Beach retreats are predicted by ensembles of six cross-shore (1D) analytical and numerical morphodynamic models, set up/forced on the basis of collected/collated information and three sea level rise scenarios (0.26, 0.82 and 1.86 m); these retreats are then compared with the recorded maximum (dry) beach widths. Projections by the unified ensemble suggest that, in the case of a 0.26 m rise, 80 {\%} of the examined beaches are to retreat by more than 20 and 16 {\%} by more than 50 {\%} of their maximum dry width. In the case of a 0.82 m rise, 72 {\%} of the tested beaches are predicted to retreat by more than 50 {\%} of their dry width and 21 {\%} by a distance at least equal to their observed maximum dry widths. A sea level rise of 1.86 m represents a ‘doom' scenario, as 75 {\%} of the beaches are predicted to retreat by more than their maximum width. These results may be conservative, as other significant beach erosion factors (e.g., decreasing beach sediment supply) have not been considered.},

abstract = {Introduction Both SES and supermarket choice have been associated with diet quality. This study aimed to assess the contributions of supermarket choice and shopping behaviors to the healthfulness of purchases and social patterning in purchases. Methods Observational panel data on purchases of fruit and vegetables and less-healthy foods/beverages from 2010 were obtained for 24,879 households, stratified by occupational social class (analyzed in 2014). Households' supermarket choice was determined by whether they ever visited market-defined high- or low-price supermarkets. Analyses also explored extent of use within supermarket choice groups. Shopping behaviors included trip frequency, trip size, and number of store chains visited. Results Households using low-price (and not high-price) supermarkets purchased significantly lower percentages of energy from fruit and vegetables and higher percentages of energy from less-healthy foods/beverages than households using high-price (and not low-price) supermarkets. When controlling for SES and shopping behaviors, the effect of supermarket choice was reduced but remained significant for both fruit and vegetables and less-healthy foods/beverages. The extent of use of low- or high-price supermarkets had limited effects on outcomes. More-frequent trips and fewer small trips were associated with healthier purchasing for both outcomes; visiting more store chains was associated with higher percentages of energy from fruit and vegetables. Conclusions Although both supermarket choice and shopping behaviors are associated with healthfulness of purchases, neither appears to contribute to socioeconomic differences. Moreover, differences between supermarket environments may not be primary drivers of the relationship between supermarket choice and healthfulness of purchases.},

abstract = {Lead concentrations were determined by isotope dilution mass spectrometry in 34 surface- and deep-water samples collected in the northeast Pacific between Hawaii and California and off the California coast using a deep-water sampler protected against fouling by contamination from the ship and hydrowire. Measured concentrations lie more than one order of magnitude below previously published open ocean values and they show that in most cases 90{\%} or more of the total lead is in a dissolved form. Lead concentrations are about 10-fold higher in surface and thermocline waters than in deep waters; values drop as low as 1 ng/kg (5 pmol/kg) below 3500 m depth. Lead profiles thus appear different compared to those of most trace metals, which show enrichment in deep waters compared to surface concentrations. Lead concentrations in surface waters increase from 5 to 15 ng/kg (25 to 75 pmol/kg) along a transect starting from a location 200 km off the California coast and continuing towards the center of the North Pacific Gyre. This increase is congruent with that observed for 210Pb concentrations in the same waters sampled at the same time. Lead is supplied to the open North Pacific largely from the atmosphere, at a rate of about 60 ng/cm2 yr, which exceeds the prehistoric oceanic output flux of authigenic lead recorded in pelagic sediments about tenfold. This excess originates from emissions from smelters and combustion of leaded gasoline, overwhelming natural lead inputs that entered the ocean during prehistoric time probably largely through rivers. Vertical lead concentration profiles below the surface mixed layer are probably not in steady state. There, concentrations must be increasing in response to the increase of anthropogenic inputs because the estimated lead residence times are more than 20 years in the thermocline and about 80 years in deep waters. Based on an estimated 10-fold input and concentration increase since the mid-eighteenth century in the surface mixed layer in the central northeast Pacific, it is calculated that the 10 ng/kg average concentration between 100 and 900 m is 2 to 5 times larger, and the 1.8 ng/kg average concentration between 900 and 5000 m depth is about 2 times larger than it was in the mid-eighteenth century. Profiles of lead concentrations in the North Atlantic are expected to be shifted generally to larger values by a factor of 2 to 3 compared to those in the North Pacific because of the effects of greater industrial lead contamination, while lead concentration profiles in the South Pacific are expected to be shifted generally to lower values compared to the North Pacific by about this same factor because of the effects of lesser industrial lead contamination. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {During the last glacial period, Greenland's climate shifted between cold (stadial) and warm (interstadial) phases that were accompanied by ocean circulation changes characterized by reduced Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during stadials. Here we present new data from the western tropical Atlantic demonstrating that AMOC slowdowns preceded some of the large South American rainfall events that took place during stadials. Based on 231 Pa/ 230 Th and Ti/Ca measurements in the same sediment core, we determine that the AMOC started to slowdown 1420 ± 250 and 690 ± 180 (1$\sigma$) years before the onset of two large precipitation events associated with Heinrich stadials. Our results bring unprecedented evidence that AMOC changes could be at the origin of the large precipitation events observed in tropical South America during Heinrich stadials. In addition, we propose a mechanism explaining the differences in the extent and timing of AMOC slowdowns associated with shorter and longer stadials.},

The discovery that this change is mainly in the P-wave velocity clearly relates the effect to the phenomenon of dilatancy in fluid-filled rocks. This interpretation is supported by the time-volume relation obtained by combining the present data with the data from previous studies. The duration of the precursor period is proportional to the square of an effective fault dimension, which indicates that a diffusive or fluid-flow phenomenon controls the time interval between the initiation of dilatancy and the return to a fully saturated condition which is required for rupture.},

abstract = {Hydrothermal activity occurs in all ocean basins, releasing high concentrations of key trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) into the oceans. Importantly, the calculated rate of entrainment of the entire ocean volume through turbulently mixing buoyant hydrothermal plumes is so vigorous as to be comparable to that of deep-ocean thermohaline circulation. Consequently, biogeochemical processes active within deep-ocean hydrothermal plumes have long been known to have the potential to impact global-scale biogeochemical cycles. More recently, new results from GEOTRACES have revealed that plumes rich in dissolved Fe, an important micronutrient that is limiting to productivity in some areas, are widespread above mid-ocean ridges and extend out into the deep-ocean interior. While Fe is only one element among the full suite of TEIs of interest to GEOTRACES, these preliminary results are important because they illustrate how inputs from seafloor venting might impact the global biogeochemical budgets of many other TEIs. To determine the global impact of seafloor venting, however, requires two key questions to be addressed: (i) What processes are active close to vent sites that regulate the initial high-temperature hydrothermal fluxes for the full suite of TEIs that are dispersed through non-buoyant hydrothermal plumes? (ii) How do those processes vary, globally, in response to changing geologic settings at the seafloor and/or the geochemistry of the overlying ocean water? In this paper, we review key findings from recent work in this realm, highlight a series of key hypotheses arising from that research and propose a series of new GEOTRACES modelling, section and process studies that could be implemented, nationally and internationally, to address these issues.},

abstract = {While anthropogenic emissions have dramatically elevated lead concentrations in the Noah Atlantic troposphere and surface waters by orders of magnitude above natural levels [Murozumi et al., 1969; Schaule and Patterson, 1983; Boyle et al., 1986], it has been assumed that the relatively low lead levels in Noah Atlantic abyssal waters are not yet contaminated [Schaule and Patterson, 1981; Flegal and Patterson, 1983]. That misperception is redressed by the following stable lead isotopic composition data which reveal the advective transport of industrial lead into those deep basin waters through the formation of Noah Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). Additionally, spatial gradients in the isotopic signatures of anthropogenic lead within the Noah Atlantic abyss appear to serve as transient tracers of contaminant penetration rates. Stable lead isotopic compositions, along with total lead concentrations, were analyzed in sea water samples collected during a suite of cruises in the far Noah Atlantic (IOC-II, 1993), western Noah Atlantic (OFP-BATS cruise, 1997), Noah African basins (MED-II, 1989 and EU-III, 1991), and equatorial Noah Atlantic (IOC-III, 1996). The samples were collected in modified Go-FlosS; lead was concentrated by organic or resin extraction (chloroform/dithizone or Chelex-AG1X8 resin), using established trace metal clean techniques in HEPA filtered laboratories (blanks account for less than 3{\%} of total lead analyzed for each sample). Stable lead isotopic ratios were measured by thermal ionization mass spectrometry (VG 5430), concurrently calibrated with NIST SRM 981. The lead concentrations of all the deep water samples, which ranged from 20 to 40 pM in the far Noah Atlantic and 30 to 60 pM in the deep Noah African basins, were oceanographically consistent with concentrations previously measured in deep waters near Bermuda [Schaule and Patterson, 1983] (25 to 45 pM) and Gibraltar [Lambert et al., 1991 ] (30 to 60 pM). All the isotopic compositions reported in Table 1 correspond to water samples from the NADW, as clearly identified by T/S diagrams},

abstract = {Leads representing a major portion of the continental surface of the earth have been sampled in pelagic sediments and isotopically analysed. About two-thirds of the lead in all Pleistocene pelagic sediments have been chemically precipitated from lead dissolved in sea water. The remaining one-third has been transported as a constituent of solid particles. The rate of chemical deposition of lead tends to be uniform everywhere, while the rate of mechanical deposition of lead varies considerably so that the .abundance ratio of these two types of occurrences is different in various pelagic deposits. Dissolved lead in the oceans originates from the chemical denudation of continents, and different drainage regions contribute leads of different isotopic composition to the oceans. The travel time of the dissolved lead which is chemically precipitated is short compared to the mixing time of different large water masses so that lead of a uniform isotopic composition is not simultaneously deposited everywhere on the ocean floors. This phenomenon prevents the use of lead as a chronometrie index in lead-rich, uranium-poor marine sediments for intervals shorter than 100 million years. The present rate of soluble lead denudation, free of industrial contamination, is seven times greater than the average rate of chemical precipitation for the Pleistocene. Lead is transported from the continents to pelagic regions in dispro-portionately greater amounts than uranium and thorium, so that the isotopic evolution of lead in surface materials of the continents is measurably affected, and the lead denuded from some regions of extensively reworked sediments contains abnormally large proportions of Pb206. The gross features of the isotopic variations of leads denuded from continental surfaces can be accounted for by postulating: 1.(1) that these leads have evolved within the continental crust above the Mohorovicic discontinuity;2.(2) that the crust consists of two phases, an exterior phase of high U/Pb and an interior phase of low U/Pb;3.(3) that the exterior phase contains lead isotopically homogeneous with the rest of the crust at the time the exterior phase was formed; and4.(4) that isotopic variations arise from different periods of aging within the exterior phase., The mean isotopic composition of lead to-day within the continental crust is obtained from the intersection of the marine lead isotopic regression line and the primary isochron of zero age for the earth. The values arer Pb206Pb204 = 18.58, Pb207/P.b204 = 15.77, Pb208/Pb204 = 38.87.},

We document, analyse, and interpret direct and rapid infiltration of precipitation to the southern margin of the Salar de Atacama halite-hosted brine aquifer during two intense precipitation events in 2012–2013. We present physical, geochemical, and stable and radioactive isotope data to detail this influx of water. The two events differ distinctly in the mechanisms of recharge. The 2012 event did not produce direct precipitation onto the salar surface, while the 2013 event did. Both events are recorded by abrupt changes in head in observation wells along the halite aquifer margin. Spatially distributed water levels rose by over 30 cm during the larger 2013 event consistent with remotely sensed observations of surface water extent. The lithium concentration and stable isotopic composition of water indicate dilution of brine and dissolution of salt with fresh water. Tritium measurements of precipitation, surface water, and groundwater all indicate modern influx of water to the halite aquifer along the southern margin. We extend these observations by examining the response of the halite aquifer as a whole to precipitation events during the period of 2000–2010. This study suggests that local recharge to the aquifer during sporadic precipitation onto the halite nucleus is an important component of the modern water budget in this hyper-arid environment. The rapid dissolution and salinization along the southern margin of the salar halite nucleus are aided by such precipitation events contributing a modern fresh water component to the water budget of the economically valuable lithium-rich brine.

abstract = { Abstract The Mount Sakurajima volcano in Kyushu, Japan, is proximal to a large residential area, and it emits an enormous amount of volcanic ash during frequent eruptions. In our previous study, we investigated, for the first time, respiratory effects of chronic exposure to volcanic ash. The study demonstrated a low prevalence of respiratory symptoms, even in the area of highest exposure; only a slight excess prevalence of symptoms appeared to be associated with exposure to volcanic ash. To confirm the findings of our previous study, the prevalence study of chronic respiratory symptoms for residents was repeated in Kanoya and Tashiro, which are located 25 and 50 km, respectively, from the crater of Mt. Sakurajima. The concentration of suspended particulate matter in Kanoya frequently exceeded the national environmental quality standards and, during summer and winter, was 2–3 times higher than that found in Tashiro. Women who were 30–59 y of age and who had resided in Kanoya or Tashiro for more than 3 y completed a modified ATS-DLD questionnaire. The prevalence of nonspecific respiratory disease was low, i.e., 6.5{\%} in Kanoya and 6.2{\%} in Tashiro; similar prevalences were found in women who had never smoked. When we restricted the analysis to individuals without a history of occupational exposure to dusts and who had no exposure to passive smoking, there was a slightly higher prevalence of nonspecific respiratory disease in Kanoya than Tashiro, but the difference was not significant. Eye symptoms were equally prevalent in the two areas. These results suggest that exposure to volcanic ash does not cause major detrimental effects to the respiratory systems of women in the highest exposure area. The results are consistent with our previous study and confirm the findings reported therein. The findings of this study are attributed to the following: (a) ash particulates are usually too large to be respired, (b) duration of high-dust concentration was brief, and (c) volcanic ash is relatively biologically inert. },

abstract = {This paper presents a review of bulk compositional data of northern African dust and its potential source sediments and includes elemental, isotope and mineralogical data. Northern African dust represents about one half of the total global atmospheric mineral dust burden, and its uplift, transport and deposition have strong impacts on climate and various terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The chemical data set shows, that an 'average northern African dust' exhibits comparable Si, Fe and Mn contents with respect to the average composition of the upper continental crust, is slightly depleted in the alkali metals K and Na, and enriched in Ti and P. However, the complete data set yields clear evidence that northern African dust and its source sediments are compositionally heterogeneous on a regional scale and that this heterogeneity can be used to differentiate between major potential source areas on the basis of so-called source markers. An evaluation of these compositional fingerprints shows that the following parameters and especially their combination are effective in the discrimination of the most active source areas in northern Africa: ratio of (Ca+Mg)/Fe [wt.{\%}], calcite (or carbonate) content, palygorskite occurrence and abundance, illite/kaolinite ratio, ENd(0) value, and 87Sr/86Sr ratio. For example, the data set corroborates previous ideas, which assign carbonate-, illite- and palygorskite-rich mineral dusts to north(west)ern source regions. Because most of the above listed source markers do not change substantially during transport, even far-traveled dusts may be assigned to specific potential source areas in northern Africa. Some limitations of the presented data set are also discussed. Our compilation reveals some substantial gaps in the knowledge of the composition of source sediments and mineral dusts from important potential source areas that should be filled in the future.The here compiled data set can be used as a reference frame, when incorporating the composition of source sediments (e.g., mineralogy) into global or regional dust transport models and can be compared with source analysis by remote sensing or back-trajectory analysis. However, source apportionment studies supported by our data set will not only be useful for actual dust samples, but will also be helpful for the understanding of paleo-wind directions and hence paleo-climatological conditions through the investigation of Quaternary eolian sediments deposited in and around northern Africa. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Purpose: Crime analysts need accurate population-at-risk measures to quantify crime rates. This research evaluates five measures to find the most suitable ambient population-at-risk estimate for 'theft from the person' crimes. Method: 1.Collect 'ambient' datasets: the 2011 Census, aggregate mobile telephone locations, and social media.2.Correlate the population measures against crime volumes to identify the strongest predictor.3.Use the Gi* statistic to identify statistically significant clusters of crime under alternative denominators.4.Explore the locations of clusters, comparing those that are significant under ambient and residential population estimates. Results and Discussion: The research identifies the Census workday population as the most appropriate population-at-risk measure. It also highlights areas that exhibit statistically significant rates using both the ambient and residential denominators. This hints at an environmental backcloth that is indicative of both crime generators and attractors - i.e. places that attract large numbers of people for non-crime purposes (generators) as well as places that are used specifically for criminal activity (attractors). Regions that are largely residential and yet only exhibit hotspots under the ambient population might be places with a higher proportion of crime attractors to stimulate crime, but fewer generators to attract volumes of people.},

abstract = {Although the negative impacts of volcanism on society are well documented and accepted, many possible benefits from volcanoes are not always fully considered. This paper provides suggestions for understanding and implementing volcanoes' benefits by suggesting further application of existing risk management frameworks to volcanology: living with risk by using the sustainable livelihoods approach at the local level. This paper presents an overview bringing established paradigms into volcanic risk management where they are sometimes absent despite their advantages. The sustainable livelihoods approach is important in its application to volcanic scenarios in four ways:(i)Understanding, communicating, and managing vulnerability and risk and local perceptions of vulnerability and risk beyond immediate threats to life.(ii)Maximising the benefits to communities of their volcanic environment, especially during quiescent periods, without increasing vulnerability.(iii)Managing crises.(iv)Managing reconstruction and resettlement after a crisis. An overview of case studies is provided showing how volcanic opportunities could be used for sustainable livelihoods. The approach of living with volcanic risks and benefits could be adopted and implemented as an integral part of changing perceptions of volcanoes and of managing volcano-related crisis and non-crisis situations. However, the sustainable livelihoods approach is not a panacea, so limitations are discussed along with why living near a volcano cannot solve all livelihood concerns. In particular, livelihood diversity and livelihood transferability to other locations assists in living with volcanoes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As Patterson and coworkers have shown, most of the lead in the modern ocean and atmosphere is of anthropogenic origin. Reductions in the utilization of leaded gasoline over the past two decades should decrease lead deposition from the atmosphere in remote locations. The search for trends in Pb deposition within a single decade is bedeviled by large-amplitude short-term variability due to the inherent noisiness of the atmosphere/ocean system. We find that, over the course of a year, lead concentrations in the surface waters of the western North Atlantic Ocean are variable (factor of 2), and in the snow deposited in central Greenland, highly variable (order of magnitude). In the western North Atlantic, 210Pb normalization minimizes this problem because 210Pb and Pb sources are spatially correlated and continental 210Pb emissions are constant. It is clear the Pb in surface waters of the western North Atlantic has decreased by a factor of 4 during the 1980s. 210Pb normalization does not help in the Arctic because stable Pb and 210Pb are not spatially correlated. Because of the order-of-magnitude variability in Greenland snow Pb linked to annual cycles, any discontinuous time series is likely to be affected by the phenomenon of aliasing. Aliasing makes it difficult to determine if there is a trend in Pb deposition in central Greenland during the 1980s; present evidence suggests that the reduction in Pb concentration in snow during the 1980s is less than a factor of two; certainly quite a bit less than observed in the western North Atlantic and less than the factor of {\textgreater}7 reduction in leaded gasoline utilization in the United States during the decade. Although we expect that decadal-scale trends in the 1970s and 1980s are in fact occurring due to the phasing out of leaded gasoline, the reported magnitude of decadal-scale trends should be regarded with some reservation until confirmed by independent samplings. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {The publicized four-stage (long-term, middle-term, short-term, and imminent) prediction of the M 7.3 1975 Haicheng, China, earthquake once generated worldwide fascination. Yet the prediction process has remained mysterious because of lack of reports on real-time documentation and details of how warnings were issued. In the present work, study of declassified Chinese documents and interviews of key witnesses have allowed us to reconstruct this important history. Our findings indicate that there were two official middle-term predictions but no official shortterm prediction. On the day of the earthquake, a county government issued a specific evacuation order, and actual actions taken by provincial scientists and government officials also effectively constituted an imminent prediction. These efforts saved thousands of lives, but the local construction style and time of the earthquake also contributed to minimizing fatalities. Evacuation was extremely uneven across the disaster region, and critical decisions were often made at very local levels. The most important precursor was a foreshock sequence, but other anomalies such as geodetic deformation, changes in groundwater level, color, and chemistry, and peculiar animal behavior also played a role.},

abstract = {Earthquakes arise from frictional ‘stick–slip' instabilities as elastic strain is released by shear failure, almost always on a pre-existing fault. How the faulted rock responds to applied shear stress depends on its composition, environmental conditions (such as temperature and pressure), fluid presence and strain rate. These geological and physical variables determine the shear strength and frictional stability of a fault, and the dominant mineral deformation mechanism. To differing degrees, these effects ultimately control the partitioning between seismic and aseismic deformation, and are recorded by fault-rock textures. The scale-invariance of earthquake slip allows for extrapolation of geological and geophysical observations of earthquake-related deformation. Here we emphasize that the seismological character of a fault is highly dependent on fault geology, and that the high frequency of earthquakes observed by geophysical monitoring demands consideration of seismic slip as a major mechanism of finite fault displacement in the geological record. },

abstract = {Measurements of the naturally occurring radionuclides, 210Po, 210Pb, 228Ra and 226Ra were conducted on water and sediment samples collected during the Arctic Ocean Section (1994) and Beaufort Sea (1995) expeditions and are used to assess circulation and shelf/slope scavenging in the Western Arctic Ocean. 228Ra concentrations are higher over the continental shelves of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas compared to interior waters, consistent with a shelf source for 228Ra. However, 228Ra/226Ra ratios for Pacific-origin water have a lower end member value (ca. 1.0) compared to literature values of 3.6 for end member 228Ra/226Ra ratios for Atlantic-origin water passing across the shelf of the Laptev Sea. The shift during the 1990s in the position of the axis of the Trans-Polar Drift and the consequent change in the pathways for the flow of freshwater from the Russian continental shelves is reflected in a shift of elevated 228Ra concentrations in surface water from the Lomonosov Ridge to the Mendeleyev Ridge. 210Pb water column distributions in the Eurasian Basin are similar to those measured in the North Atlantic and indicate scavenging residence times of 15-20 yr. 210Pb concentrations are lower in intermediate waters of the Makarov and Canada Basins, because of enhanced scavenging at the continental margin. The lowest 210Pb concentrations ({\textless}0.2 dpm/1001) were in the halocline and are a result of scavenging over the continental shelves. Low 210Pb levels in upper halocline waters of Pacific origin extend hundreds of kilometers into the interior of the Makarov and Canada Basins and reflect scavenging over the Chukchi and Beaufort Sea shelves. Low 210Pb levels in lower halocline waters of Atlantic origin reflect both scavenging over the Barents and Kara Sea shelves and removal during boundary current transport along the continental margin in the Makarov and Canada Basins. Focusing factors calculated from comparisons of 210Pb sediment inventories with 210Pb water column deficits confirmed the net scavenging of 210Pb at the continental margins. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The Variscides of Iberia have a bilateral symmetry with east vergence in the eastern branch and west vergence in the western, on both sides of a Centro-Iberian Zone (CIZ), with predominant steep axial planes. All the structures curve around the Ibero-Armorican Arc (IAA). Unconformities in the sedimentary sequences of Cambrian to Early Ordovician age were ascribed to "Sardic phase" by correlation with similar tectonosedimentary events in Sardinia. Recent studies showed diachronism between these events in Sardinia and Iberia but migration of major geodynamic regime in time may be due to regional variation of major events at plate tectonic scale. We studied in detail two critical areas in the CIZ, the Marao anticline in the NE and the Amendoa-Carvoeiro synform in the SW. Two unconformities can be put in evidence, as elsewhere in CIZ. A stronger lower unconformity of a Volcano-Sedimentary Complex of Lower Arenig (and Tremadocian?) age on top of a Cambrian clastic sequence with flysch characteristics; and a milder upper unconformity of Armorican Quartzite of Arenig age on both the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex and the Cambrian sequences. The lithostratigraphy of the studied areas is described and correlated with other areas in Iberia. The Volcano-Sedimentary Complex and coeval magmatic bodies with bimodal composition are briefly described. The Sardic event corresponds to folds with steep axial planes at high angles to Variscan structures that produce the penetrative cleavage that cut across the unconformity surfaces. Sardic thrusts are also present and can be explained by thin-skinned compressive tectonics. Sardic folds and thrusts suggest a brief period of transient inversion between a major extensional regime from Cambrian to Devonian. The obliquity of Sardic structures to Variscan compression suggests a component of transpression during the Sardic tectonic event, corresponding to a tectonically enhanced unconformity near the Cambro-Ordovician boundary. The transient Sardic inversion is interpreted in terms of a break-up unconformity, related to the migration of an intracratonic rift; in the Ordovician this rift moves into the SW of Ossa Morena Zone (OMZ) and since then become the SW Iberia suture during the Variscan Wilson cycle. This migration induced transient compression and dextral strike-slip in the major boundary between CIZ and OMZ due to presence of incipient primary curvature in this segment of IAA.

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2017 Detailed geological mapping, field observations and structural analyses demonstrate that Early Ordovician (‘Sardic') deformation occurred in the early Palaeozoic successions that are now incorporated in the Variscan Nappe zone of SE Sardinia. This deformation is represented by folds that formed at a shallow depth, lack a significant syn-folding axial planar foliation, and do not affect the overlying Late Ordovician – Devonian sedimentary sequence. These deformation features can be related to the development of the Sardic Unconformity and to calc-alkaline volcanism in several now-scattered terranes of Ordovician northern Gondwana. This reflects a convergent geodynamic setting that in the study sector appears to have failed to reach a continental collisional end-stage. Associating the structural data from this study with those of several published research studies, a preliminary evaluation about which tectonic setting could better fit is proposed. These conditions affected the eastern side of the northern Gondwana margin more or less contemporaneously with the opening of the Rh{\'{e}}ic Ocean and the closure of the Qaidam Ocean, before the amalgamation of the Hunia terranes.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal variations of Pb were reconstructed from three corals along an east-west transect of the Singapore Straits - in proximity to one of the largest emerging Asian cities and one of the world's busiest ports. In addition to establish the variation in seawater Pb concentration, sources of Pb were also investigated via Pb isotopes in seawater and corals and compared with the isotopes in local aerosols and other potential Pb sources. The annual variation of Pb in Singapore corals seems to be related to local annual precipitation while the decadal-scale variation may be related to the long-term development of the region. The decrease of Pb/Ca in coral after 2005 coincided with the regional phasing out of leaded gasoline. The 206Pb/207Pb ratios in Singapore corals rose from as low as {\~{}}1.166 during the 1960s to {\~{}}1.189 by the late 1990s, and fluctuated between 1.180-1.198 from the late 1990s to 2010. 206Pb/207Pb in recent Singapore corals was elevated relative to Singapore atmospheric aerosols ({\~{}}1.147, which is typical of urban aerosols throughout the southeastern Asian and Indonesian region). The linear distribution of 206Pb/207Pb vs. 208Pb/207Pb in triple isotope plots suggests two end-member mixing between the aerosol-Pb as a low 206Pb/207Pb end-member and an unidentified source with higher 206Pb/207Pb. Possible high 206Pb/207Pb sources include: surface runoff from imported south Chinese Pb, crustal materials from riverine inputs (sediments and suspended matter) or land reclamation, and vessels/dockyard activities.},

abstract = {Comprehensive synoptic datasets (surface water down to 4000 m) of dissolved cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb) and silver (Ag) are presented along a section between 34A degrees S and 57A degrees S in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Southern Ocean to the south off South Africa. The vertical distributions of Cu and Ag display nutrient-like profiles similar to silicic acid, and of Cd similar to phosphate. The distribution of Mn shows a subsurface maximum in the oxygen minimum zone, whereas Pb concentrations are rather invariable with depth. Dry deposition of aerosols is thought to be an important source of Pb to surface waters close to South Africa, and dry deposition and snowfall may have been significant sources of Cu and Mn at the higher latitudes. Furthermore, the advection of water masses enriched in trace metals following contact with continental margins appeared to be an important source of trace elements to the surface, intermediate and deep waters in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Hydrothermal inputs may have formed a source of trace metals to the deep waters over the Bouvet Triple Junction ridge crest, as suggested by relatively enhanced dissolved Mn concentrations. The biological utilization of Cu and Ag was proportional to that of silicic acid across the section, suggesting that diatoms formed an important control over the removal of Cu and Ag from surface waters. However, uptake by dino- and nano-flagellates may have influenced the distribution of Cu and Ag in the surface waters of the subtropical Atlantic domain. Cadmium correlated strongly with phosphate (P), yielding lower Cd / P ratios in the subtropical surface waters where phosphate concentrations were below 0.95 mu M. The greater depletion of Cd relative to P observed in the Weddell Gyre compared to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current could be due to increase Cd uptake induced by iron-limiting conditions in these high-nutrient-low-chlorophyll waters. Similarly, an increase of Mn uptake under Fe-depleted conditions may have caused the highest depletion of Mn relative to P in the surface waters of the Weddell Gyre. In addition, a cellular Mn-transport channel of Cd was possibly activated in the Weddell Gyre, which in turn may have yielded depletion of both Mn and Cd in these surface waters},

abstract = {Reptiles have repeatedly invaded marine environments despite their physiological constraints as air breathers. Marine reptiles were especially successful in the Mesozoic as major predators in the sea. There were more than a dozen groups of marine reptiles in the Mesozoic, of which four had more than 30 genera, namely sauropterygians (including plesiosaurs), ichthyopterygians, mosasaurs, and sea turtles. Medium-sized groups, such as Thalattosauria and Thalattosuchia, had about ten genera, whereas small groups, such as Hupehsuchia and Pleurosauridae, consisted of only two genera or less. Sauropterygia and Ichthyopterygia were the two longest surviving lineages, with 185 and 160 million years of stratigraphic spans, respectively. Mesozoic marine reptiles explored many different swimming styles and diets. Their diet included fish, cephalopods, other vertebrates, and hard-shelled invertebrates, whereas no herbivore is known at this point. Sauropterygians and ichthyopterygians gave rise to cruising forms that probably invaded outer seas. Intermediate forms that led to the cruising species are known in Ichthyopterygia but not as much in Sauropterygia. Discovery of new fossils should eventually reduce the gap in the fossil record.},

abstract = {Slow earthquakes are characterized by a wide spectrum of fault slip behaviors and seismic radiation patterns that differ from those of traditional earthquakes. However, slow earthquakes and huge megathrust earthquakes can have common slip mechanisms and are located in neighboring regions of the seismogenic zone. The frequent occurrence of slow earthquakes may help to reveal the physics underlying megathrust events as useful analogs. Slow earthquakes may function as stress meters because of their high sensitivity to stress changes in the seismogenic zone. Episodic stress transfer to megathrust source faults leads to an increased probability of triggering huge earthquakes if the adjacent locked region is critically loaded. Careful and precise monitoring of slow earthquakes may provide new information on the likelihood of impending huge earthquakes.},

abstract = {This study presents dissolved Pb concentration and isotopic composition distributions from GEOTRACES GA03, the U.S. North Atlantic Transect. Pb in the ocean is primarily derived from anthropogenic sources and Pb fluxes into the North Atlantic Ocean have been steadily decreasing following the phase-out of alkyl leaded gasoline usage in North America and Europe between 1975 and 1995. A compilation of dissolved Pb profiles from three stations occupied repeatedly during the last three decades reveals a dramatic decrease in concentrations within the surface layers and the thermocline maxima, although elevated concentrations greater than 60pmol/kg are still observed in the center of the North Atlantic gyre where ventilation timescales are longer than at the western boundary. The evolution of stable Pb isotopes at these stations shows a shift from dominantly North American-like composition in surface waters in the early 1980s towards a more European-like composition in later years. The most recent shallow signatures at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series station (BATS) show an even more recent trend returning to higher {\textless}sup{\textgreater}206{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}207{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb ratios after the completed phase-out of leaded gasoline in Europe, presumably because recently deposited Pb is more strongly influenced by industrial and incineration Pb than by residual alkyl leaded gasoline utilization. In surface waters, trends toward a more prominent European influence are also found in the middle of the basin and toward the European coast, coincident with higher concentrations of surface dissolved Pb. Scavenging of anthropogenic Pb is observed within the TAG hydrothermal plume, and it is unclear if there is any significant contribution to deep water by basaltic Pb leached by hydrothermal fluids. In the upper water column, many stations along the transect show Pb concentration maxima at {\~{}}100m depth, coincident with a low {\textless}sup{\textgreater}206{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}207{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb isotopic signature that is typical of European emission sources. Although Pb ores from the United States historically tend to carry {\textless}sup{\textgreater}206{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}207{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb signatures {\textgreater}1.17 (Hurst, 2002), subsurface signatures as low as 1.1563 in {\textless}sup{\textgreater}206{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}207{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb were observed in this feature. This signature appears to be carried westward within saline Subtropical Underwater (STUW), that ventilates from the Central Eastern part of the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre where the lowest surface isotope {\textless}sup{\textgreater}206{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}207{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb ratios are observed. Along the western boundary, deep water masses of different ages carry distinct isotope ratios corresponding to their respective times of ventilation. Finally, a low {\textless}sup{\textgreater}206{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}207{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb signature in bottom water along the Eastern margin suggests that there may be some mobilization of European-derived anthropogenic Pb from recent surface deposits on the ocean floor.},

abstract = {Recent large earthquakes that caused ground shaking larger than anticipated have generated interest in how to improve earthquake hazard mapping. Issues under discussion include how to evaluate maps' performance, how to assess their uncertainties, how to make better maps, and how to best use maps given their limitations.An important question is what to do after an earthquake yielding shaking larger than anticipated. Hazard mappers have two choices. One is to regard the high shaking as a low‐probability event allowed by the map, which used estimates of the probability of future earthquakes and the resulting shaking to predict the maximum shaking expected with a certain probability over a given time (Hanks et al., 2012; Frankel, 2013). The usual choice, however, is to accept that high shaking was not simply a low‐probability event consistent with the map, and revise the map to show increased hazard in the heavily shaken area (Fig. 1).Figure 1. (top) Japanese seismic‐hazard maps before and after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. The predicted hazard has been increased both along the east coast, where the 2011 earthquake occurred, and on the west coast. (http://www.j-shis.bosai.go.jp/map/?lang=en; last accessed December 2014.) (bottom) Comparison of successive Italian hazard maps (Stein et al., 2013). The 1999 map was updated to reflect the 2002 Molise earthquake, and the 2006 map will likely be updated after the 2012 Emilia earthquake.Whether and how much to revise a map is complicated, because a new map that better describes the past may or may not better predict the future. For example, increasing the predicted hazard after an earthquake on a fault will make better predictions if the average recurrence time is short compared to the map's time window but will overpredict future shaking if the average recurrence time is much longer than the map's time window. {\ldots}},

Problems arise in calculation of water fluxes because of uncertainties in (a) values of off-axis fluxes and (b) the partition of axial heat flow between high-temperature black smoker and lower-temperature diffuse flow. Of the various geochemical methods of estimating fluxes, 3 He/heat data are extremely variable, the Mg method is sensitive to flank fluxes, Sr isotopes agree with geophysical estimates only if flank fluxes are important, Li isotopes data are consistent with geophysical values, and Ge/Si ratios give low fluxes, which may reflect low-temperature processes not yet fully quantified. Estimates of hydrothermal heat and water fluxes derived from these approaches are presented as are hydrothermal chemical fluxes at the ridge axis, off axis, and as affected by hydrothermal plumes.},

The decrease during the 1980s can be attributed to the phasing out of leaded gasoline in the United States. Lead concentration levels of the 1990s may be supported by emissions from high temperature industrial activities in the USA rather than by residual leaded gasoline emissions. Lead concentrations in the thermocline above similar to 700 m depth have continued to decrease over this time period. Further decreases in surface water Pb concentrations may be minimal in coming decades, but continued propagation and evolution of the lead distribution in deeper waters should be expected.

Phylogenies including these fossil taxa show that paddle-like limbs were independently derived, and that the varied limb morphologies were produced by evolutionary modifications to different aspects of the limb skeleton. Ancient marine reptiles modify the limb by reducing the relative size of the epipodials, modifying the perichondral and periosteal surface of elements distal to the propodials, and evolving extremes of hyperphalangy and hyperdactyly. Developmental genetic models illuminate gene systems that may have controlled limb evolution in these animals.},

abstract = {Trace metal clean techniques were used to sample Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) station ALOHA on seven occasions between November 1998 and October 2002. On three occasions, full water-column profile samples were obtained; on the other four occasions, surface and near-surface euphotic zone profiles were obtained. Together with three other published samplings, this site may have been monitored for "dissolved" (???0.4 or ???0.2 ??m) Fe more frequently than any other open ocean site in the world. Low Fe concentrations ({\textless}0.1 nmol kg
                        -1) are seen in the lower euphotic zone, and Fe concentrations increase to a maximum in intermediate waters. In the deepwaters ({\textgreater}2500 m), the concentrations we observe (0.4-0.5 nmol kg
                        -1) are significantly lower than some other deep North Pacific stations but are similar to values that have been reported for a station 350 miles to the northeast. We attribute these low deepwater values to transport of low-Fe Antarctic Bottom Water into the basin and a balance between Fe regeneration and scavenging in the deep water. Near-surface waters have higher Fe levels than observed in the lower euphotic zone. Significant temporal variability is seen in near-surface Fe concentrations (ranging from 0.2-0.7 nmol kg
                        -1); we attribute these surface Fe fluctuations to variable dust deposition, biological uptake, and changes in the mixed layer depth. This variability could occur only if the surface layer Fe residence time is less than a few years, and based on that constraint, it appears that a higher percentage of the total Fe must be released from North Pacific aerosols compared to North Atlantic aerosols. Surprisingly, significant temporal variability and high particulate Fe concentrations are observed for intermediate waters (1000-1500 m). These features are seen in the depth interval where high ??
                        3He from the nearby Loihi Seamount hydrothermal fields has been observed; the total Fe/
                        3 He ratio implies that the hydrothermal vents are the source of the high and variable Fe. The vertical profile of Mn at ALOHA qualitatively resembles other North Pacific Mn profiles with surface and intermediate water maxima, but there are some significant quantitative differences from other reported profiles. The ???0.4 ??m Mn concentration is highest near the surface, decreases sharply in the upper 500 m, then shows an intermediate water maximum at 800 m and then decreases in the deepest waters; these concentrations are higher than observed at a station 350 miles to the northeast that shows similar vertical variations. It appears that there is a significant Mn gradient (throughout the water column) from HOT towards the northeast. Compared to the first valid oceanic Pb data for samples collected in 1976, Pb at ALOHA in 1997-1999 shows decreases in surface waters and waters shallower than 200 m. Pb concentrations in central North Pacific surface waters have decreased by a factor of 2 during the past 25 yr (from ???65 to ???30 pmol kg
                        -1); surface water Pb concentrations in the central North Atlantic and central North Pacific are now comparable. We attribute the surface water Pb decrease to the elimination of leaded gasoline in Japan and to some extent by the U.S. and Canada. We attribute most of the remaining Pb in Pacific surface waters to Asian emissions, more likely due to high-temperature industrial activities such as coal burning rather than to leaded gasoline consumption. A 3-year mixed-layer time series from the nearby HALE-ALOHA mooring site (1997-1999) shows that there is an annual cycle in Pb with concentrations ???20{\%} higher in winter months; this rise may be created by downward mixing of the winter mixed layer into the steep gradient of higher Pb in the upper thermocline (Pb concentrations double between the surface and 200 m). From 200 m to the bottom, Pb concentrations decrease to levels of 5-9 pmol kg
                        -1 near the bottom; for most of the water column, thermocline and deepwater Pb concentrations do not appear to have changed significantly during the 23-yr interval. Copyright ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We measured Pb isotopic composition and concentration in sediment samples close to the sea water interface in 6 box-cores from the NE Atlantic, 2 box-cores from the Sargasso Sea, and one from the US continental shelf. The anthropogenic Pb input to marine sediments due to the increase of Pb contamination over the ocean during the last century can be identified in all these cores. In the eastern part of the Atlantic, i.e., in regions under aeolian influence from Europe, Pb pollution can be recognized using its distinctive unradiogenic composition, clearly different from the upper-crustal values commonly found in pre-Holocene sediments. In contrast, Pb pollution in regions influenced by North American sources can be identified only in detailed concentration profiles because the American Pb pollution has an isotopic composition much closer to that of the natural detrital Pb input coming from weathering of the continental crust. Pb excess inventories are in good agreement with fluxes estimated from sedimenttrap data and with the time record of Pb-contamination increase given by analyses in coral growth bands. Inventories of Pb contamination to the sediments of the Mud Patch (American shelf) are tenfold higher (84 ??g/cm2) than those to Hatteras and Bermuda abyssal plains (4.3 and 2.8 ??g/cm2). ?? 1990.},

abstract = {Tectonic and sedimentary m{\'{e}}langes, rocks with block-in-matrix fabric often referred to as ‘chaotic', are widespread in the circum-Mediterranean collisional orogenic belts as well as in submerged Mediterranean Arcs. These rock types have been defined originally as ‘Argille scagliose' (Bianconi, 1840) and ‘olistostromes' (Flores, 1955, 1959) in the outcrops of the Apennine chain (Italy). Both terminology and concepts have undergone a rather complex evolution through time owing to the gradual recognition of similar chaotic bodies in all the circum-Mediterranean orogenic belts. Submarine mud volcanoes of the Mediterranean region, also composed by block-in-matrix, more commonly referred to as mud breccias, have a much younger history. These mud breccias were discovered in 1981 and, since then, a growing number of sea-going geophysical and geological expeditions have allowed the recognition of a major mud volcano belt in the Eastern Mediterranean and of a number of mud diapirs and mud volcano fields from the Black Sea to the Gulf of Cadiz. Structural, textural and genetic similarities between the mud breccias of the Mediterranean mud volcanoes and the olistostromes and Argille scagliose of the Apennines were noted from the very beginning, but the matter has not been the focus of any detailed study. In this paper, the use of the terms in the geological literature is analysed, the distribution of these rock units in the Mediterranean region explored and the assumed genetic processes are identified in order to formulate a common genetic model that can be applied to the evolution of the circum-Mediterranean sedimentary basins.},

Models of the transport of several trace metals through a semi-enclosed marginal sea and across western North Atlantic continental shelves are used to examine the fluxes of metals through the coastal zone. The relationships between metals and salinity, in both nearshore and offshore areas, are also used to exemplify the consequences of mixing processes in estuaries and to determine apparent riverine end-member compositions on larger spatial scales. Comparisons are then made between the riverine influxes to the ocean deduced from metal-salinity relationships and generalized coastal zone transport models. The results of the application of both approaches are discussed in the context of geochemical processes operating in the coastal zone. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic lead (Pb) from industrial activities has greatly altered the distribution of Pb in the present-day oceans, but no continuous temporal Pb evolution record is available for the Indian Ocean despite rapidly emerging industries around the region. Here, we present the coral-inferred annual history of Pb concentration and isotope ratios in the surface Indian Ocean since the mid-20th century (1945-2010). We analyzed Pb in corals from the Chagos Archipelago, western Sumatra and Strait of Singapore - which represent the central Indian Ocean via nearshore sites. Overall, coral Pb/Ca increased in the mid-1970s at all the sites. However, coral Pb isotope ratios evolve distinctively at each site, suggesting Pb contamination arises from different sources in each case. The major source of Pb in the Chagos coral appears to be India's Pb emission from leaded gasoline combustion and coal burning, whereas Pb in western Sumatra seems to be largely affected by Indonesia's gasoline Pb emission with additional Pb inputs from other sources. Pb in the Strait of Singapore has complex sources and its isotopic composition does not reflect Pb from leaded gasoline combustion. Higher 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb ratios found at this site may reflect the contribution of Pb from coals and ores from southern China, Indonesia, and Australia, and local Pb sources in the Strait of Singapore. It is also possible that the Pb isotope ratios of Singapore seawater were elevated through isotope exchange with natural fluvial particles considering its delta setting. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Changes in the strength and position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) are an important component of climate variability in the tropical Atlantic. The Cariaco Basin, located on the northern margin of Venezuela, is sensitive to tropical Atlantic climate change and its sediments provide a record of past ITCZ behavior. Today, the Cariaco Basin experiences two distinct seasons that reflect the annual migration of the Atlantic ITCZ. Between January and March, when the ITCZ lies south of the equator, northeasterly trade winds sit directly over Cariaco Basin and strong coastal upwelling and dry conditions dominate. Beginning in June-July, as the ITCZ moves north, local rainfall reaches a maximum and the upwelling diminishes or disappears. Here we summarize new and previously published data on the river-derived terrigenous fraction of Cariaco Basin sediments, as well as comparisons to other paleoclimate records, which together suggest a coherent climatologic response in the tropical Atlantic triggered by a pattern of ITCZ migration that mimics the seasonal cycle. During periods of cooler North Atlantic SSTs, on time-scales ranging from the Little Ice Age to the Younger Dryas to the cold stadials of the last glacial, decreased detrital delivery to Cariaco Basin from local rivers suggests a southward shift in the mean latitudinal position of the ITCZ. During warm interstadials and periods of Holocene and deglacial warmth, northward shifts in ITCZ position and its belt of convective rainfall are inferred from increased detrital delivery to the basin. Whether the rapid shifts in ITCZ position and precipitation recorded by Cariaco Basin sediments and other regional records reflect a response to forcing originating in the high latitude Atlantic or to forcing potentially sourced in the tropics is a key question yet to be fully answered. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The process of ocean acidification is well documented in field data, and the rate will accelerate over this century unless future CO2 emissions are curbed dramatically. Acidification alters seawater chemical speciation and biogeochemical cycles of many elements and compounds. One well-known effect is the lowering of calcium carbonate saturation states, which impacts shell-forming marine organisms from plankton to benthic molluscs, echinoderms, and corals. Many calcifying species exhibit reduced calcification and growth rates in laboratory experiments under high-CO2 conditions. Ocean acidification also causes an increase in carbon fixation rates in some photosynthetic organisms (both calcifying and noncalcifying).

abstract = {Marine Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide crusts form by precipitation of dissolved components from seawater. Three hydrogenetic crust samples (one phosphatized) and two hydrothermal Mn-oxide samples were subjected to a sequential-leaching procedure in order to determine the host phases of 40 elements. Those host-phase associations are discussed with respect to element speciation in seawater. The partitioning of elements between the two major phases, Mn oxide and Fe oxyhydroxide, can in a first-order approximation be explained by a simple sorption model related to the inorganic speciation of the elements in seawater, as has been proposed in earlier models. Free and weakly complexed cations, such as alkali and alkaline earth metals, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, T1(I), and partly Y, are sorbed preferentially on the negatively charged surface of the MnO2 in hydrogenetic crusts. The driving force is a strong coulombic interaction. All neutral or negatively charged chloro (Cd, Hg, T1), carbonate (Cu, Y, Pb, and U), and hydroxide (Be, Sc, Ti, Fe, Zr, Nb, In, Sn, Sb, Te, Hf, Ta, Bi, Th, and T1(III)) complexes and oxyanions (V, Cr, As, Se, Mo, and W) bind to the slightly positively charged surface of the amorphous FeOOH phase. While coulombic interaction can explain the sorption of the negatively charged species, the binding of neutral species is based on specific chemical interaction. Organic complexation of elements in deep-ocean water seems to be at most of minor importance. Surface oxidation can explain some strong metal associations, e.g. of Co and T1 with the MnO2 and Te with the FeOOH. Sorption reactions initially driven by coulombic forces are often followed by the formation of specific bonds between the adsorbate and the atoms of the oxide surface. Differences in the associations of some metals between the non-phosphatized and phosphatized hydrogenetic crusts and between the hydrogenetic and the hydrothermal samples reflect the different physico-chemical environments of formation and speciations in oxic seawater vs. less-oxic fluids, especially for the redox-sensitive metals such as Mo and V. These environmental-related differences indicate that the methodology of chemical speciation used here in combination with spectroscopic methods may allow for the detection of changes in paleoceanographic conditions recorded during the several tens of millions of years of crust growth. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

@book{Kanamori2003,
abstract = {This chapter focuses on prediction of earthquakes. Because earthquakes occur suddenly, often with devastating consequences, earthquake prediction is a matter of great interest among the public and emergency service officials. The term “earthquake prediction” is often used to mean two different things. In the common usage, especially among the public, “earthquake prediction” means a highly reliable, publicly announced, short-term (within hours to weeks) prediction that will prompt some emergency measures (e.g., alert, evacuation, etc.). Exactly how reliable this type of prediction should be depends on the social and economic situations of the region involved. The issue is whether the quality of prediction is good enough to benefit the society in question. The chapter lists six attributes required for this type of prediction: (1) It must specify a time window. (2) It must specify a space window. (3) It must specify a magnitude window. (4) It must give some sort of indication of the author's confidence in the reliability of the prediction. (5) It must give some sort of indication of the chances of the earthquake occurring anyway, as a random event. (6) It must be written and presented in some accessible form so that data on failures are as easily obtained as data on success. Earthquake prediction means a statement regarding the future seismic activity in a region, and the requirement for high reliability is somewhat relaxed in this usage. Despite the progress made in understanding the physics of earthquakes, the predictions of earthquake activity made today are inevitably very uncertain, mainly because of the highly complex nature of earthquake process.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the question not of how, but why people actively choose to live with continued exposure to considerable hazard. A field survey of the human-volcano interaction at Bromo Volcano was based on semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. The recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed according to recurrent themes in the answers. Findings from field investigation were then confronted with previous existing concepts of human exposure to natural hazards. The result shows that the interaction between humans and the volcanic environment at Bromo volcano is multifaceted and complex. The Tengger people choose - rather than being forced - to live with volcanic hazards. They are not only exposed to its negative consequence, but also enjoy benefits and opportunities of physical, spiritual and socio-cultural nature that arise within the human-volcanic system. Following this perspective, the concept of risk itself must be revisited and expanded from a one-sided focus on hazardous processes to a more holistic view of risk that includes the various positive aspects that pertain to the entire system. The development of a generic human-volcanic system model could provide the basis for the development of an open-risk concept.},

@article{Salisbury2008,
abstract = {The Lawn Hill circular structure in northwest Queensland contains unambiguous evidence of an extraterrestrial impact, including planar deformation features in quartz, impact diamonds, widespread shatter cone formation and impact melt breccia in the Mesoproterozoic basement. The question of its relevance to ore genesis is investigated because the world-class Century Zn-Pb deposit is situated at the conjunction of the 100+ km Termite Range Fault and the previously defined margin of the impact structure. The impact structure is considered to be a 19.5 km wide feature, this constrained in part by the outer margin of an annulus of brecciated and highly contorted limestone. New evidence is presented indicating impact into this Cambrian limestone, including: (i) 'dykes' of brecciated Cambrian limestone extending hundreds of metres into the Mesoproterozoic basement; (ii) highly contorted bedding in the limestone annulus compared with essentially undeformed limestone away from the impact site; as well as (iii) a 1 Mt megaclast of Mesoproterozoic Century-like ore suspended in the limestone. Through aerial photograph analysis, large-scale convoluted flow structures within the limestone are identified, and these are interpreted to indicate that parts of the Cambrian sequence may have been soft or only semi-consolidated at the time of impact. This highly contorted limestone bedding is suggested to represent slump-filling of an annular trough in response to impact-induced partial liquefaction of a sediment veneer. The age of impact is therefore considered to be concurrent with limestone formation during the Ordian to early Templetonian, at 520-510 Ma. Formation of the Century deposit is found to be unrelated to impact-generated hydrothermal activity, although some minor hydrothermal remobilisation of metals occurred. However, there was macro-scale remobilisation of gigantic ore fragments driven by impact-induced lateral and vertical injection of limestone into the Proterozoic sediments. The limestone-filled annular trough surrounds a 7.8 km diameter central uplift, consistent with formation of a complex crater morphology.},

abstract = {Crime continues to cast a shadow over citizen well-being in big cities today, while also imposing huge economic and social costs. Timely understanding of how criminality emerges and how crime patterns evolve is crucial to anticipating crime, dealing with it when it occurs and developing public confidence in the police service. Every day, about 10,000 crime incidents are reported by citizens, recorded and geo-referenced in the London Metropolitan Police Service Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) database. The unique nature of this dataset allows the patterns to be explored at particularly fine temporal granularity and at multiple spatial resolutions. This study provides a framework for the exploratory spatio-temporal analysis of crime patterns that combines visual inquiry tools (interactive animations, space-time cubes and map matrices) with cluster analysis (spatial-temporal scan statistics and the self-organizing map). This framework is tested on the CAD dataset for the London Borough of Camden in March 2010. Patterns of crime through space and time are discovered and the clustering methods were evaluated on their ability to facilitate the discovery and interpretation of these patterns.},

The forefin elements of various ichth-yopterygians are identified, based on osteogenetic sequences and topological arrangements. Both lines of evidence, ontogenetic and morphological, support a single conclusion that Stenopterygius, and all other ichthyopterygians be-longing to the clade that survived into the Jurassic, lack digit I of the forelimb. Digits I and II are probably absent in Shastasaums and closely related forms. The topology along the primary axis and digital arch is conservative among all ichthyopterygians examined, as expected from the underlying mechanism of limb development.},

Marine productivity maxima and increased precipitation and riverine discharge from northern South America are closely linked to interstadial (warm) climate events of marine isotope stage 3, as recorded in Greenland ice cores. Increased precipitation at this latitude during interstadials suggests the potential for greater moisture export from the Atlantic to Pacific, which could have affected the salinity balance of the Atlantic and increased thermohaline heat transport to high northern latitudes. This supports the notion that tropical feedbacks played an important role in modulating global climate during the last glacial period.},

The time history of quasi-static slip along the plate interface, based on small repeating earthquakes that were part of the migrating seismicity, suggests that two sequences involved slow-slip transients propagating toward the initial rupture point. The second sequence, which involved large slip rates, may have caused substantial stress loading, prompting the unstable dynamic rupture of the mainshock.},

An in situ benthic chamber, equipped with electronic devices for monitoring and adjustment of oxygen and pH and with a temperature detector, was used. The benthic chamber experiment enabled study of the temporal trend of metals and nutrients when oxygen concentration varied in a controlled environment. Although particular care was devoted to chamber deposition and parameter control, sediment resuspension occurred at the beginning of the experiment and O2 fluctuations were observed during the course of the experiment. Pb concentration was affected by both resuspension and oxic conditions in bottom water, which prevented determination of any reasonable Pb flux value. Cd and Cu, not influenced by oxygen fluctuations, reached an equilibrium phase in a short period with initial positive fluxes from sediment of 0.68 (S.D.=0.07) and 6.9 (S.D.=5.6) pmol cm-2 h-1, respectively. With regard to nitrogen species, the highest positive flux was that of N-NH4 (10.5, S.D.=2.4, nmol cm-2 h-1) whose concentration increased in the chamber, while nitrate concentration (initial flux of -5.7, S.D.=1.5, nmol cm-2 h-1) immediately decreased after the beginning of the experiment. Nitrite concentration was almost constant throughout the experiment and its flux was generally low (initial flux 0.1, S.D.=0.9, nmol cm-2 h-1). Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {We describe two transient slow slip events that occurred before the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. The first transient crustal deformation, which occurred over a period of a week in November 2008, was recorded simultaneously using ocean-bottom pressure gauges and an on-shore volumetric strainmeter; this deformation has been interpreted as being an M6.8 episodic slow slip event. The second had a duration exceeding 1. month and was observed in February 2011, just before the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake; the moment magnitude of this event reached 7.0. The two events preceded interplate earthquakes of magnitudes M6.1 (December 2008) and M7.3 (March 9, 2011), respectively; the latter is the largest foreshock of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. Our findings indicate that these slow slip events induced increases in shear stress, which in turn triggered the interplate earthquakes. The slow slip event source area on the fault is also located within the downdip portion of the huge-coseismic-slip area of the 2011 earthquake. This demonstrates episodic slow slip and seismic behavior occurring on the same portions of the megathrust fault, suggesting that the faults undergo slip in slow slip events can also rupture seismically. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Pb and Pb isotope ratios in the modern ocean have been altered significantly by anthropogenic Pb inputs over the past century. Most studies of anthropogenic Pb in the ocean have focused on the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, and the impact of anthropogenic Pb inputs to the Indian Ocean and processes controlling the distribution of Pb in the Indian Ocean are poorly known. This study presents the Pb and Pb isotopic composition (206Pb/207Pb, 208Pb/207Pb) of 11 deep stations from the Indian Ocean Japanese GEOTRACES cruise (KH-09-5), from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea to the Southern Ocean (62??S). The Pb isotope ratios of the Indian Ocean range 1.140-1.190 for 206Pb/207Pb and 2.417-2.468 for 208Pb/207Pb, with lower ratios appearing in the shallow waters of the northern Indian Ocean and higher ratios appearing in the deep layers of the Southern Ocean. This result agrees with a previous study on Pb concentrations (Echegoyen et al., 2014) showing that the Indian Ocean, particularly its northern part, is largely perturbed by anthropogenic Pb inputs. 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb of the Indian sector Southern Ocean are still lower than natural Pb, showing this region was also affected by anthropogenic Pb. Anomalously low or high 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb were observed in the thermocline and shallow waters of the southern Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea, which are ascribed to water mass distribution (e.g., Subantarctic Mode Water) and evolving Pb isotope ratios of this region as dominant anthropogenic Pb sources change. 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb in the Bay of Bengal are higher than those in the Arabian Sea, which might be the result of the anthropogenic Pb inputs from different provenance or seawater exchanging Pb isotopes with natural particles derived from rivers and/or sediments at the basin boundaries.},

The resulting organic metal complex is small, neutrally charged, and lipophilic in character. Short-term uptake experiments using a coastal diatom demonstrated that these lipophilic organic Zn and Mn complexes diffuse across the lipid bilayer that constitutes the plasma membrane. In addition, Cu2+ and Pb2+ ions in seawater solution undergo exchange reactions with Zn and Mn and form lipophilic organic Cu and Pb complexes that also diffuse across the plasma membrane and into the cytosol of the cell. Intracellularly, these trace metals are thought to dissociate from the transport ligand and complex intracellular ligands. Based on these results, the presence of dithiocarbamate fungicides in surface water can inadvertantly enhance the passive uptake of a variety of toxic heavy metals from the water into microorganisms.},

abstract = {Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is now recognized as an important pathway between land and sea. As such, this flow may contribute to the biogeochemical and other marine budgets of near-shore waters. These discharges typically display significant spatial and temporal variability making assessments difficult. Groundwater seepage is patchy, diffuse, temporally variable, and may involve multiple aquifers. Thus, the measurement of its magnitude and associated chemical fluxes is a challenging enterprise. A joint project of UNESCO and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has examined several methods of SGD assessment and carried out a series of five intercomparison experiments in different hydrogeologic environments (coastal plain, karst, glacial till, fractured crystalline rock, and volcanic terrains). This report reviews the scientific and management significance of SGD, measurement approaches, and the results of the intercomparison experiments. We conclude that while the process is essentially ubiquitous in coastal areas, the assessment of its magnitude at any one location is subject to enough variability that measurements should be made by a variety of techniques and over large enough spatial and temporal scales to capture the majority of these changing conditions. We feel that all the measurement techniques described here are valid although they each have their own advantages and disadvantages. It is recommended that multiple approaches be applied whenever possible. In addition, a continuing effort is required in order to capture long-period tidal fluctuations, storm effects, and seasonal variations. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A physical model based on determining the fraction of the tidal prism that returns to the estuary on the next high tide is used to estimate the flushing time of the Okatee River estuary. The return flow factor (b) of 0.81 yields a flushing time of 2 days. A mass balance model of 228Ra and salinity is also used to estimate b. This model yields an average b = 0.79, virtually the same as the physical model. A third model based on the decay of 224Ra relative to 228Ra is used to determine the apparent age of water in the estuary. These ages range from 1.6 to 5 days, with an average of 3.4 days. These three independent estimates are in remarkably close agreement, certainly within the error of each estimate. We use these residence times to develop a mass balance model for the radium isotopes in the Okatee estuary. We consider decay, mixing, sedimentary input, river input, and submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). The major loss term for each isotope is mixing with water in Port Royal Sound; the major input for each isotope is SGD. At steady state these terms must balance. Knowing the water age and the radium isotope composition of groundwater entering the Okatee allows us to estimate an average SGD flux of 1 m3/s. The SGD flux is a factor of 3–4 greater during the summer relative to the winter. This SGD supplies a considerable quantity of nutrients and carbon into the Okatee system.},

Additionally, land reclamation, mining, and ship building activities are recorded by elevated Al/Ca ratios from 1900 to 1950. The coral record indicates that high levels of Zn, Pb and Al occur coincidentally with local wars, and may have contributed to partial colony mortality. Pb/Ca does not correlate well with hemispheric proxy records after 1950, indicating that coastal corals may be recording local rather than hemispheric contamination. Pb/Ca levels in Hong Kong, Guangdong and Hainan corals imply a continuous supply of Pb-based contamination to southern China not reflected in hemispheric signals. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here we report a vertical profile of seawater 206Pb/207Pb ratio and a meridional section of Pb concentration in the North Pacific Ocean. We observe 2-3-fold increases in Pb concentration along the deep-water flow path and a deep-water 206Pb/207Pb ratio (∼1.188) substantially lower than the pre-industrial value (∼1.210). These data suggest that anthropogenic Pb has invaded the North Pacific abyssal water and become the predominant Pb source there.

In addition to the spatial distribution, Pb contents in Ogasawara coral have gradually increased during last 108 years.

@article{Kesler2012,
abstract = {Previous studies of the availability of lithium for use in batteries to power electric vehicles (EVs) have reached the generally encouraging conclusion that resources are sufficient to meet growing demand for the remainder of the 21st century. However, these surveys have not looked past estimates of lithium resource to the geological constraints on deposit size and composition that will allow the resources to be converted to reserves from which lithium can be produced economically. In this survey, we review the relevant geological features of the best characterized pegmatite, brine and other types of lithium deposits and compare their potential for large-scale, long-term production. The comparison shows that the average brine deposit (1.45. Mt Li) is more than an order of magnitude larger than the average pegmatite deposit (0.11. Mt Li) and that brine deposits, especially the large Atacama (Chile) and Uyuni (Bolivia) deposits, have a much larger total lithium resource (21.6. Mt Li). Brine deposits clearly have a much greater capacity for large-scale, long-term production than do pegmatite deposits. However, individual brine deposits differ considerably and successful production from one deposit does not necessarily assure success at others. Conversion of brine resources to reserves will depend on the degree of compartmentalization of brine reservoirs, the extent to which brine can be recovered without dilution from recharge waters and degradation of salt-bearing reservoir rock, and whether other constituents of the brines, including potassium, magnesium, bromine and boron, restrict processing or the capacity of production to respond to changes in demand for lithium. Despite their smaller size and total estimated resource (3.9. Mt), pegmatites will remain of interest because of their wider geographic distribution and consequently lesser susceptibility to supply disruptions and their more lithium-dominant compositions, which might allow more flexible response to market changes. Some deposits will be amenable to large-scale mining, but significant production might also come from selective, underground mining of small deposits in areas with low labor costs. Even the largest pegmatite deposits, such as those at Greenbushes (Australia) and Manono-Kitolo (Democratic Republic of Congo) have estimated resources that are similar to only an average brine deposit. For this reason, continuous, long-term production from pegmatites will require extensive exploration and discovery of new pegmatite deposits and districts. Two other types of lithium deposits, unusual rocks and unusual fluids, have also received attention. Deposits consisting of rocks and minerals that are enriched in lithium by interaction with brines and hydrothermal solutions, including the large Jadar (Serbia) and King Valley (USA) deposits, have estimated resources of about 3.4. Mt Li. Unusual brines in oilfields and the Salton Sea geothermal field (USA) contain an estimated 2. Mt Li. Both of these deposit types will require new processing methods but are likely to become important because of their lithium-dominant compositions and relatively large size. The total lithium resource in these deposits (31.1. Mt Li) far exceeds estimated lithium demand of up to 20. Mt Li (including consideration for recycling) in all markets through 2100. The difference between these two estimates should be vied largely as a challenge rather than a comfort. Evaluation of the economic extractability of these resources will require large investments and result in only partial success. If prices provide sufficient encouragement and exploration is sustained, however, lithium resources should be available for the next century. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Of the known elements, nearly 80{\%} are either metals or metalloids. The highly reactive nature of most metals result in their forming complexes with other compounds such oxygen, sulfide and chloride. Although this reactivity is the primary means by which they are toxic, many metals, in trace amounts, are vital to normal physiological processes; examples include iron in oxygen transport, manganese and selenium in antioxidant defense and zinc in metabolism. With these essential metals toxicity occurs when concentrations are either too low or too high. For some metals there are no physiological concentrations that are beneficial; as such these metals only have the potential to cause toxicity. This chapter focuses on four of these: arsenic, mercury, lead and thallium.},

Feedbacks between sea-level rise and marsh accretion rates based on mechanistic modeling were included. Simulation results predict extensive marsh losses in microtidal regimes behind the barrier islands of Long Island, vulnerable dry lands on barrier islands, and opportunities for upland migration of coastal marshes. Results also indicate changes in the composition of marsh types. Confidence of predictions due to model parameter variabilities and spatial data error were estimated with the uncertainty estimation module. Likelihood maps of land cover changes were produced. Uncertainty results suggest that variability in land cover projections is mostly due to the wide range in potential sea-level rise signals by 2100 while impact from uncertainties in model parameters, spatial data errors and linked models is less significant.},

In order to gain more insight, the isotopic compositions of major sources of Pb in the environment as determined by several authors are described in detail. These include, above all, the former use of leaded gasoline, coal combustion, industrial activities (e.g., metallurgy) and waste incineration.

In the early 1980s, 206Pb/207Pb ratios in the North African Basin averaged 1.193 ± 0.005 (1 {\&}{\#}963;). Similar radiogenic ratios within the level of analytical precision (average 0.29{\%}) were found in the Labrador and Iceland Basins (1.198 ± 0.006) and in the Norwegian Sea (1.196 ± 0.008). These radiogenic mixed layer signatures along with atmospheric global lead emission patterns suggest that most North Atlantic lead in the early 1980s was derived from North American leaded gasoline. Samples in the East Iberian Basin near Portugal and France showed lower 206Pb/207Pb ratios, between 1.167 and 1.182, indicating a significant influence of less radiogenic atmospheric lead transported from Europe and possibly the influence of the Rio Tinto acid mine drainage very close to shore in the Gulf of Cadiz. [Pb] across the entire North Atlantic Basin ranged between 54 and 145 pmol/kg, with the lowest values (54{\&}{\#}8211;74 pmol/kg) found at high latitudes ({\textgreater}65°N). In the late 1980s, surface waters in the western subtropical North Atlantic (North American Basin/Sargasso Sea, {\textgreater}47°W) and in the eastern subtropical North Atlantic (North African Basin/Central Iberian Basin, {\textless}45°W) showed very similar 206Pb/207Pb signatures with little zonal variation, ranging from 1.177 to 1.192. Lead concentrations ranged between 47 and 137 pmol/kg, increasing slightly from west to east. South of 25°N in the equatorial North Atlantic, crossing the subtropical/tropical surface water boundary, the 206Pb/207Pb seawater signatures were significantly less radiogenic (1.170{\&}{\#}8211;1.175) and concentrations were lower ({\&}{\#}8804;51 pmol/kg). This difference suggests a relative increase in the atmospheric lead supply from the western Mediterranean/North African continent via Trade Easterlies and illustrates the effective barrier between the subtropical/tropical surface water exchanges. Triple-isotope plots (206Pb, 207Pb, and 208Pb) suggest that most of the lead can be accounted for by wet aerosol deposition derived from the adjacent landmasses of America to the west (transported via the North American Westerlies) and from Europe to the east (transported via the European Easterlies) and probably by some advected surface waters from the Sargasso Sea. The 1989 triple-isotope plot suggests, however, a third lead source in the subtropical western North Atlantic, possibly leaded gasoline from Mexico. Gasoline lead emission patterns as well as atmospheric lead isotope signatures confirm that gasoline was the main pollutant source in the early 1980s but suggest that contributions from high-temperature industrial processes (coal combustion, steel manufacture, waste incineration) have been increasing in the late 1980s. From isotopic mass balance estimates, lead inputs to the 1980s North Atlantic were dominated by North American sources ({\textgreater}53{\%}). These elemental and isotopic results demonstrate the strongly variable isotopic and elemental signatures of North American and European lead throughout the North Atlantic Ocean, frequently dominated by high 206Pb/207Pb and [Pb] North American signatures throughout the subtropical North Atlantic gyre.},

abstract = {In common with most thrust belts, the Moine Thrust Zone, Scotland, preserves a foreland-propagating sequence of thrusting. However, significant examples of local to regional overstep sequences are also recognized and their interpretation remains controversial. Remapping of the northernmost Moine Thrust Zone has defined a thick belt of mylonites in the centre of which lies the ductile WNW-directed Moine Thrust. The base of the mylonite belt, however, is marked by a regionally significant, low-angle, west-directed brittle fault, here termed the Lochan Riabhach Thrust, that truncates thrust-related structures in its footwall. Comparison of the tectonic stratigraphy of the mylonite belt with that preserved in a downfaulted outlier to the west at Durness indicates that the Lochan Riabhach Thrust cuts down-section in its footwall and therefore appears to be extensional. Locally, it is unequivocally breached by underlying imbricate thrusts. We prefer to interpret the Lochan Riabhach ‘Thrust' as an extensional fault that formed during a hiatus in thrust stacking. We relate this faulting episode to the changes in the stability of the evolving orogenic wedge and reiterate that such extensional faults may be common, although possibly unrecognized, features in many other thrust belts.},

These are not parts of olistostromes, or other mass movement deposits, but appear to have travelled into the basin independently; hence the term ‘isolated olistolith' seems appropriate for them. Soft-sediment deformation structures around the margins of one well-exposed olistolith suggest an analogy with ‘outrunner-blocks' recently described from a modern submarine slope-failure complex by Prior et al (1982, 1984). In both cases the blocks appear to have travelled considerable distances across very low slopes without disturbing the underlying sediments to any great extent.

In contrast, the deep water ({\textgreater}1000 m) Pb concentrations were lower (6–37 pmol kg–1), and constituted a mix of background (natural) Pb and anthropogenic Pb inputs from preceding decades. Deep water below the Western Subarctic Gyre (WSAG) contained more industrial Pb than below the NPSG, which was attributed to a calculated 60-fold greater flux of particulate Pb to abyssal waters near the Asian continent.

abstract = {Due to their outstanding resolution and well-constrained chronologies, Greenland ice-core records provide a master record of past climatic changes throughout the Last Interglacial-Glacial cycle in the North Atlantic region. As part of the INTIMATE (INTegration of Ice-core, MArine and TErrestrial records) project, protocols have been proposed to ensure consistent and robust correlation between different records of past climate. A key element of these protocols has been the formal definition and ordinal numbering of the sequence of Greenland Stadials (GS) and Greenland Interstadials (GI) within the most recent glacial period. The GS and GI periods are the Greenland expressions of the characteristic Dansgaard-Oeschger events that represent cold and warm phases of the North Atlantic region, respectively. We present here a more detailed and extended GS/GI template for the whole of the Last Glacial period. It is based on a synchronization of the NGRIP, GRIP, and GISP2 ice-core records that allows the parallel analysis of all three records on a common time scale. The boundaries of the GS and GI periods are defined based on a combination of stable-oxygen isotope ratios of the ice ($\delta$18O, reflecting mainly local temperature) and calcium ion concentrations (reflecting mainly atmospheric dust loading) measured in the ice. The data not only resolve the well-known sequence of Dansgaard-Oeschger events that were first defined and numbered in the ice-core records more than two decades ago, but also better resolve a number of short-lived climatic oscillations, some defined here for the first time. Using this revised scheme, we propose a consistent approach for discriminating and naming all the significant abrupt climatic events of the Last Glacial period that are represented in the Greenland ice records. The final product constitutes an extended and better resolved Greenland stratotype sequence, against which other proxy records can be compared and correlated. It also provides a more secure basis for investigating the dynamics and fundamental causes of these climatic perturbations.},

abstract = {This report is part of an effort by the U.S. Geological Survey to update existing mineral deposit models and to develop new ones. The global transition away from hydrocarbons toward energy alternatives increases demand for many scarce metals. Among these is lithium, a key component of lithium-ion batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles. Lithium (Li) brine deposits account for about three-fourths of the world's lithium production (U.S. Geological Survey, 2011). Updating an earlier deposit model by Asher-Bolinder (1991), we emphasize geologic information that might directly or indirectly help in exploration for lithium brine deposits, or for assessing regions for mineral resource potential. Special attention is given to the best-known deposit in the world—Clayton Valley, Nevada (Kunasz, 1974; Davis and others, 1986; Price and others, 2000; Zampirro, 2004); Munk and others (2011a, b)—and to the giant Salar de Atacama, Chile (Risacher and others, 2003; Lowenstein and Risacher, 2009).},

abstract = {The history of the oceanic anthropogenic lead (Pb) transient in the North Atlantic Ocean for the past 220??yr is documented here from measurements of Pb concentration and isotope ratios from annually-banded corals that grew in coastal seawaters near Bermuda and from seawater samples collected during the last 20??yr of the 20th century. Anthropogenic Pb emissions in this area have been dominated by the industrialization of North America beginning in the 1840s, the introduction of leaded gasoline beginning in the 1920s and its phase-out that began in the mid-1970s. The phase-out of leaded gasoline was largely completed by the late 1990s. Coral Pb concentrations occur at a constant low level of about 5??nmol Pb/mol Ca ({\~{}} 15??pmol/kg in seawater) from the late 1700s to {\~{}} 1850. From {\~{}} 1850 to {\~{}} 1900 there is a small increase rising to a plateau at {\~{}} 25??nmol Pb/mol Ca ({\~{}} 80??pmol/kg in seawater) in the 1930s until the late 1940s, at which point Pb concentrations rapidly increase to {\~{}} 60??nmol Pb/mol Ca ({\~{}} 200??pmol/kg in seawater). In the mid 1970s, Pb began to decline to {\~{}} 25??nmol Pb/Ca (40??pmol/kg in seawater) by the end of the 20th century, comparable to levels occurring in the early 20th century. Pb isotope ratios (Pb I.R.) show maximum 206Pb/207Pb = 1.21 and 208Pb/207Pb = 2.49 in the middle of the 19th century. We conclude that this signal is a reflection of the early dominance of Upper Mississippi Valley Pb ore in the United States, as previously seen in the estuarine sediments of Rhode Island. After 1900, Pb I.R. decrease only slightly until the 1960s when there is a significant local maximum in the 1970s to 206Pb/207Pb = 1.19 and 208Pb/207Pb = 2.45 as low-Pb I.R. sources were phased out in the United States. Then, as US leaded gasoline utilization decreased more rapidly than European Pb gas utilization (which has lower Pb I.R.), western North Atlantic Pb I.R. decreased to 206Pb/207Pb = 1.17 and 208Pb/207Pb = 2.44, their lowest values in the past two centuries. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Paton2008,
abstract = {This paper discusses how people's interpretation of their experience of volcanic hazards and public volcanic hazard education programs influences their risk perception and whether or not they adopt measures that can mitigate their risk. Drawing on four studies of volcanic risk perception and preparedness, the paper first examines why experiencing volcanic hazards need not necessarily motivate people to prepare for future volcanic crises. This work introduces how effective risk communication requires communities and civic agencies to play complementary roles in the risk management process. Next, the findings of a study evaluating the effectiveness of a public volcanic hazard education program introduce the important role that social interaction amongst community members plays in risk management. Building on the conclusions of these studies, a model that depicts preparing as a social process is developed and tested. The model predicts that it is the quality of the relationships between people, communities and civic agencies that determines whether people adopt measures that can reduce their risk from volcanic hazard consequences. The implications of the model for conceptualizing and delivering volcanic hazard public education programs in ways that accommodate these relationships is discussed. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Potash basins similar to those in the geological past no longer exist at present. There are only hypersaline lakes such as those in the Tibetan Plateau where carnallite [KCl{\textperiodcentered}MgCl2{\textperiodcentered}6H2O] precipitates. Given that the purpose of common saltworks is to obtain NaCl, the halitic stage is not exceeded. By contrast, saltworks extracting lithium by solar evaporation reach more advanced stages of brine evolution and saline precipitation. In the Salar de Atacama saltworks, with a relative humidity commonly below 30{\%} (monthly average), salts precipitate following a sequence of halite [NaCl], sylvite [KCl], carnallite and bischofite [MgCl2{\textperiodcentered}6H2O] and display a useful model of evolution similar to that which gave rise to MgSO4-free potash deposits in the past. Prismatic-acicular gypsum [CaSO4{\textperiodcentered}2H2O], the main accessory mineral, is transformed into a less hydrated calcium sulfate, probably anhydrite [CaSO4], during carnallite precipitation. Mineral crystal size and annual sedimentary thickness of each paragenesis are compared with those in ancient potash deposits. The behavior of sylvite and carnallite as cements is observed at the onset of their precipitation in ponds where both minerals coexist with previous halite. Millimeter cyclicity due to day-night thermal variations is observed in these saltworks, whereas cm- and mm-cyclicities have been interpreted in ancient sites as annual (regular) and intra-annual (irregular), respectively. Conditions similar to those existing at the Salar de Atacama were necessary to preserve carnallite, which is commonly the most evolved mineral in the ancient deposits. The development of potash deposits in the South Pyrenean Foreland Basin and the Rhine Graben, near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, is attributed to global aridity and cooling and to the basin restriction associated with a decrease in the ocean level caused by the spread of the Antarctic ice cap.},

Hypotheses regarding systematic errors are tested using appropriate statistical approaches, including methods of maximum likelihood. Finally, a “best-fit” statistical model is presented to explain the error as well as to develop a model that can correct it.

abstract = {Humans have injected lead (Pb) massively into the earth surface environment in a temporally and spatially evolving pattern. A significant fraction is transported by the atmosphere into the surface ocean where we can observe its transport by ocean currents and sinking particles. This study of the Indian Ocean documents high Pb concentrations in the northern and tropical surface waters and extremely low Pb levels in the deep water. North of 20°S, dissolved Pb concentrations decrease from 42 to 82 pmol/kg in surface waters to 1.5-3.3 pmol/kg in deep waters. South of 20°S, surface water Pb concentrations decrease from 21 pmol/kg at 31°S to 7 pmol/kg at 62°S. This surface Pb concentration gradient reflects a southward decrease in anthropogenic Pb emissions. The upper waters of the north and central Indian Ocean have high Pb concentrations resulting from recent regional rapid industrialization and a late phase-out of leaded gasoline, and these concentrations are now higher than currently seen in the central North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans. The Antarctic sector of the Indian Ocean shows very low concentrations due to limited regional anthropogenic Pb emissions, high scavenging rates, and rapid vertical mixing, but Pb still occurs at higher levels than would have existed centuries ago. Penetration of Pb into the northern and central Indian Ocean thermocline waters is minimized by limited ventilation. Pb concentrations in the deep Indian Ocean are comparable to the other oceans at the same latitude, and deep waters of the central Indian Ocean match the lowest observed oceanic Pb concentrations.},

Hydrogenetic nodules and crusts formed in areas of erosion or nondeposition on Cretaceous seamounts and plateaus of the Pacific plate, and to a lesser extent on seamounts of remnant arcs of Palaeogene to Neogene ages. The Cretaceous seamount deposits are most enriched in Co, and the plateaus less so, while both show moderate Ni enrichment. Nodules and crusts are rare in enclosed backarc basins, which have not been affected by deep water circulation. A slight early-diagenetic influence is observed in some Pacific basin nodules. By contrast, modern hydrothermal Mn deposits are broadly distributed on active submarine volcanoes and backarc rifts. These hydrothermal Mn deposits consist typically of pure Mn oxide containing negligible levels of metals except for Mg, Ba, K and Li. Similar fossil hydrothermal Mn deposits are observed in places on old basement or within deep cores as geological records of past hydrothermal activity. Manganese},

abstract = {The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is going to raise the bar for data protection laws around the world. My EU institution (the Office of the European Data Pro-tection Supervisor, or EDPS) was closely involved—as were other data protection authorities—in the policy dis-cussions, though not in the negotiations. 1 Political agree-ment was reached in December 2015, and the text is expected to become law before the summer. 2 We believe that we have had some influence over the process, but we do not pretend that the final outcome is perfect, and in some ways it is quite far from the ideal. Nevertheless, we intend to be among the loudest champions of this reform, which is quite simply, and by a long way, the most ambi-tious endeavour so far to secure the rights of the individ-ual in the digital realm for a generation. The GDPR contains considerable flexibility, and certainly more than it appears at first sight. It aims to entrench privacy on the ground and allows different sectors to contribute to new norms and best practices appropriate to specific circumstances. Its cornerstone is the notion of trust: trust in data controllers to treat personal information responsibly, and trust that the rules will be effectively enforced. It will be incumbent on Europe's independent data protection authorities, working through a reinforced cooperation facility called the European Data Protection Board, to foster that trust and accountability, by being transparent and accessible to stakeholders and efficient in providing relevant and timely guidance on compliance. The GDPR will have two major strategic consequences. The first consequence is that the GDPR sets up a genuine platform for global partnerships. This reflects the global nature of data flows, enabled by technologies and driven by creative, disruptive business models. Over half the countries in the world now have a data pro-tection and/or privacy law, and most are strongly in-fluenced by the European approach, a trend towards the 'global ubiquity' of data privacy. 3 The regulation pro-mises a wider scope for cooperation between authorities and data controllers both within the EU and internation-ally. It should galvanise efforts for a more consistent standard contractual clauses, speed up the validation process for binding corporate rules, and help them dove-tail with similar arrangements elsewhere in the world. I hope that the new provisions for codes of conduct, seals, certification, and accreditation processes will in-centivise controllers inside and outside the EU to take the initiative in devising standards which are both busi-ness friendly and in the interests of individuals. The second consequence is that data protection is no longer an optional extra. The Court of Justice of the European Union applies these rules strictly, interpreting them in the light of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and favouring the rights and interests of the individual above corporate or business aims, however reasonable and legitimate. The EU cannot retreat from these core values. Data protection authorities will have to be vigilant in monitoring implementation of the GDPR, and applying the newly amplified range of pos-sible sanctions in case of violation. Accountability therefore becomes central. 4 This term, which has currency in English but in few other lan-guages, has in fact very ancient roots. The word is * European Data Protection Supervisor, Brussels. 1 See EDPS Opinion on the Commission's proposed reform package, March 2012: EDPS Opinion 3/2015 (with addendum) 'Europe's big opportunity', EDPS recommendations on the EU's options for data protection reform, July/October 2016. 2 The most up-to-date text reflecting the agreement reached at the political level by the Council and the European Parliament is Council of the European Union document 15039/15, dated 15 December 2015. At the time of writing, this was still subject to checking and translation into the EU's other official languages by lawyer-linguists. The final version will be put to the Council and the European Parliament for adoption, which is expected in May or June 2016, prior to publication in the EU Official Journal.},

Unlike other commercial salar brines currently being processed, the high levels of magnesium and sulphate in Uyuni brine would create difficulties during processing if conventional techniques were used. A two-stage precipitation was therefore first adopted in the process using lime to remove Mg and sulphate as Mg(OH)2and gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O). Boron (at 0.8 g/L in the raw brine), a valuable metal yet deleterious impurity in lithium products, could also be mostly recovered from the brine by adsorption at a pH lower than pH11.3 in this first stage. The residual Mg and Ca (including that added from lime) which were subsequently precipitated as Ca-Mg oxalate could be roasted to make dolime (CaO{\textperiodcentered}MgO) for re-use in the first stage of precipitation. Evaporation of the treated brine up to 30 folds would produce 20 g/L Li liquors. The salt produced during evaporation was a mixture of NaCl and KCl, containing acceptable levels of sulphate, Mg, Ca, etc. The final precipitation of lithium at 80-90°C produced a high purity (99.55{\%}) and well crystalline lithium carbonate. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Since iron is an important micronutrient, deposition of iron in mineral aerosols can impact the carbon cycle and atmospheric CO(2). This paper reviews our current understanding of the global dust cycle and identifies future research needs. The global distribution of desert dust is estimated from a combination of observations of dust from in situ concentration, optical depth, and deposition data; observations from satellite; and global atmospheric models. The anthropogenically influenced portion of atmospheric desert dust flux is thought to be smaller than the natural portion, but is difficult to quantify due to the poorly understood response of desert dust to changes in climate, land use, and water use. The iron content of aerosols is thought to vary by a factor of 2, while the uncertainty in dust deposition is at least a factor of 10 in some regions due to the high spatial and temporal variability and limited observations. Importantly, we have a limited understanding of the processes by which relatively insoluble soil iron (typically similar to 0.5{\%} is soluble) becomes more soluble (1-80{\%}) during atmospheric transport, but these processes could be impacted by anthropogenic emissions of sulfur or organic acids. In order to understand how humans will impact future iron deposition to the oceans, we need to improve our understanding of: iron deposition to remote oceans, iron chemistry in aerosols, how desert dust sources will respond to climate change, and how humans will impact the transport of bioavailable fraction of iron to the oceans.},

abstract = {Lead isotopic compositions and Pb and Ba concentrations have been measured in ice cores from Law Dome, East Antarctica, covering the past 6500 years. 'Natural' background concentrations of Pb (∼0.4 pg/g) and Ba (∼1.3 pg/g) are observed until 1884 AD after which increased Pb concentrations and lowered 206Pb/207Pb ratios indicate the influence of anthropogenic Pb. The isotopic composition of 'natural' Pb varies within the range 206Pb/207Pb=1.20-1.25 and 208Pb/207Pb=2.46-2.50, with an average rock and soil dust Pb contribution of 8-12{\%}. A major pollution event is observed at Law Dome between 1884 and 1908 AD, elevating the Pb concentration four-fold and changing 206Pb/207Pb ratios in the ice to ∼1.12. Based on Pb isotopic systematics and Pb emission statistics, this is attributed to Pb mined at Broken Hill and smelted at Broken Hill and Port Pirie, Australia. Anthropogenic Pb inputs are at their greatest from ∼1900 to ∼1910 and from ∼1960 to ∼1980. During the 20th century, Ba concentrations are consistently higher than 'natural' levels and are attributed to increased dust production, suggesting the influence of climate change and/or changes in land coverage with vegetation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

I use cumulative data of vehicle, mobile phone, laptop, and digital camera production to show that demand will overshoot the available global Lithium resources before 2025. Even if 100{\%} of all Lithium-ion batteries were recycled today, recycling could not prevent this resource depletion in time. As the increasing Lithium scarcity will increase the price, it will be feasible to mine diluted resources with a strong environmental impact. I highlight these impacts in Lithium-rich Bolivia, the potential new “Saudi Arabia of Lithium.” Lithium extraction is likely to cause substantial water pollution, and—through impacts on native diversity—facilitate human health impacts from cyanobacteria that are normally kept at bay by native flamingos. The strongly intertwined Lithium extraction impacts on the environment, biodiversity, and human health from evaporative ponds and ore mining need to be taken into consideration when we discuss resource protection and opportunities from Lithium recycling. Overall, sensible Lithium recycling strategies can provide effective resource and environmental protection right now but urgently need to be supplemented by alternative technologies in the near-future.},

Their multiple industrial, domestic, agricultural, medical and technological applications have led to their wide distribution in the environment; raising concerns over their potential effects on human health and the environment. Their toxicity depends on several factors including the dose, route of exposure, and chemical species, as well as the age, gender, genetics, and nutritional status of exposed individuals. Because of their high degree of toxicity, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury rank among the priority metals that are of public health significance. These metallic elements are considered systemic toxicants that are known to induce multiple organ damage, even at lower levels of exposure. They are also classified as human carcinogens (known or probable) according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer. This review provides an analysis of their environmental occurrence, production and use, potential for human exposure, and molecular mechanisms of toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. },

abstract = {Although the negative impacts of volcanism on society are well documented and accepted, many possible benefits from volcanoes are not always fully considered. This paper provides suggestions for understanding and implementing volcanoes' benefits by suggesting further application of existing risk management frameworks to volcanology: living with risk by using the sustainable livelihoods approach at the local level. This paper presents an overview bringing established paradigms into volcanic risk management where they are sometimes absent despite their advantages. The sustainable livelihoods approach is important in its application to volcanic scenarios in four ways:(i)Understanding, communicating, and managing vulnerability and risk and local perceptions of vulnerability and risk beyond immediate threats to life.(ii)Maximising the benefits to communities of their volcanic environment, especially during quiescent periods, without increasing vulnerability.(iii)Managing crises.(iv)Managing reconstruction and resettlement after a crisis. An overview of case studies is provided showing how volcanic opportunities could be used for sustainable livelihoods. The approach of living with volcanic risks and benefits could be adopted and implemented as an integral part of changing perceptions of volcanoes and of managing volcano-related crisis and non-crisis situations. However, the sustainable livelihoods approach is not a panacea, so limitations are discussed along with why living near a volcano cannot solve all livelihood concerns. In particular, livelihood diversity and livelihood transferability to other locations assists in living with volcanoes.},

Here, based on Pb isotope measurements, we reassess the importance of natural and anthropogenic Pb sources to the tropical North Atlantic following the nearly complete global cessation of leaded petrol use. Significant proportions of up to 30–50{\%} of natural Pb, derived from mineral dust, are observed in Atlantic surface waters, reflecting the success of the global effort to reduce anthropogenic Pb emissions. The observation of mineral dust derived Pb in surface waters is governed by the elevated atmospheric mineral dust concentration of the North African dust plume and the dominance of dry deposition for the atmospheric aerosol flux to surface waters. Given these specific regional conditions, emissions from anthropogenic activities will remain the dominant global marine Pb source, even in the absence of leaded petrol combustion. 1},

abstract = {Environmental context. Dissolved organic matter protects aquatic microorganisms from toxic metals by complexing and decreasing the concentration of the biologically reactive species such as free metal ions. However, there are some cases of enhancement of toxic effects when humic acids are present, which is thought to be due to effects of adsorbed humic acids on cell membranes. For a marine diatom, humic acids adsorbed to cell surfaces enhanced metal adsorption, whereas intracellular metal contents decreased as a result of metal binding by humic acids. These findings suggest that the diatom wall, the frustule, presents a barrier against direct effects of adsorbed humic acids on the plasma membrane.. Metal complexation by dissolved organic matter, as humic acids, is considered to decrease metal bioavailability by lowering the free metal ion concentration. However, dissolved organic matter adsorption on cell surfaces can modify cell membrane properties, which can also influence metal uptake. Copper and lead accumulation and internalisation by the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii were studied in the absence and presence of humic acids, and adsorption of humic acids to cell surfaces was evaluated. Both Pb and Cu intracellular concentrations decreased in the presence of humic acids according to labile metal concentrations measured by anodic stripping voltammetry, whereas total (intracellular plus adsorbed) metal content was enhanced in the presence of humic acids, probably owing to enhanced metal plus humics adsorption to cell surfaces. The results of the present work stress the importance of differentiating between intracellular and total cellular metal in bioavailability studies, and suggest that the silica frustule of diatoms represents a barrier against humic acids effects on cell membranes. },

abstract = {The goodness of fit for competing statistical models with different numbers of degrees of freedom cannot be assessed solely by the residual sum of squares, because more complex models will naturally have lower residuals. A standard approach to hypothesis testing for large data sets is to use the objective Bayesian information criterion (BIC), which penalizes models with larger numbers of free parameters appropriately. We apply this method to the analysis of time delays from data on seismic shear-wave splitting in SW Iceland. The same data set has previously been used to estimate the time at which stress-modified micro-cracking reaches an inferred state of fracture criticality. The method does not forecast the location of the event, however, the time and magnitude were consistent with the actual occurrence of an M = 5 earthquake in the region. The forecast was based on a multi-line model with 17 degrees of freedom (five straight lines, each with a start and end point, plus the variance, with four endpoints being fixed by the occurrence of a main shock), and a signal-to-noise ratio near unity. The BIC is used to assess this forecast in comparison with competing curve fits for Poisson, multiline, sinusoidal, or polynomial (truncated Taylor expansion) hypotheses. The null hypothesis of random occurrence can only be rejected formally for the sinusoidal model, implying cyclical recurrence with a period of 134.6 days. All other models we consider have a lower BIC. We also analyse the selected portion of the data set used to make the forecast of fracture criticality using Gaussian statistics. The 95 per cent confidence intervals on the predicted main shock magnitude range between magnitudes of 3.9 and 6.7. The time range indicated by the same confidence limits starts 42 days before the actual event; a clear end cannot be located. The relation between predicted magnitude and waiting time is not significantly different from that inferred from the background Gutenberg–Richter frequency–magnitude relation within the model uncertainties. Thus, it is not possible, based on the data, to formally reject the hypothesis that the magnitude 5 event was part of the normal background seismicity. },

The readily soluble concentrations of Cu (4-256 pmol m-3), Ni (0.1-54 pmol m-3), Ba (0.2-60 pmol m-3), Zn (6-316 pmol m-3), Cd (0.01-0.29 pmol m-3) and Pb (0.4-22 pmol m-3) were measured in the aerosols, along with total concentrations of crustal elements (Fe, Al and Mn) to evaluate the crustal contributions. Air mass back trajectories suggested most of the aerosol samples had spent several days over the ocean prior to collection. The highest metal concentrations were observed in aerosols close to South Africa, Australia and major cities in South America, although these concentrations were lower than had been reported previously in the literature. Apart from Ba, which had a major crustal source, the trace metals were enriched relative to crustal sources in most samples, including some collected thousands of kilometers from emission sources. The mean trace metal concentrations in the remote Indian Ocean were lower than those measured in the Atlantic Ocean. Even lower concentrations are reported in the literature for the remote Pacific Ocean. In contrast to previous studies, no clear north-south gradient is observed in the concentrations of the trace metals in the aerosols. Lead isotope measurements were also carried out on aerosol samples using a multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer to assist in source apportionment. Clear differences were noted in the isotope ratios collected on either side of the Indian Ocean with Australian lead ore dominating over much of the eastern and mid-southern Indian Ocean. Samples collected over the western Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean under South African influence had lead isotopes quite different from those seen in South African cities in the past, and are closer in ratio to the coal signature of the region. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

High concentrations of terrigenous elements and low Ca concentrations along the African and South American margins reflect the dominance of terrigenous input in these regions. Single element concentrations and elemental ratios including Ca (e. g., Fe/Ca) are too sensitive to dilution effects (enhanced biological productivity, carbonate dissolution) to allow reliable reconstructions of terrestrial climate. Other elemental ratios reflect the composition of terrigenous material and mirror the climatic conditions within the continental catchment areas. The Atlantic distribution of Ti/Al supports its use as a proxy for eolian versus fluvial input in regions of dust deposition that are not affected by the input of mafic rock material. The spatial distributions of Al/Si and Fe/K reflect the relative input of intensively weathered material from humid regions versus slightly weathered particles from drier areas. High biogenic opal input however influences the Al/Si ratio. Fe/K is sensitive to the input of mafic material and the topography of Andean river drainage basins. Both ratios are suitable to reconstruct African and South American climatic zones characterized by different intensities of chemical weathering in well-understood environmental settings.},

abstract = {This paper presents results from the first complete investigation of the dissolved and suspended trace metals cadmium, copper, cobalt, nickel, lead, and zinc in the water column of the Weddell Sea, Antarctica. A total of 35 stations was covered in the central Weddell Sea and the shelf areas around the Filchner depression and Dronning Mauds Land. Snow samples were collected from the sea ice and from the Antarctic continent to evaluate the importance of the fresh water influence on the Weddell Sea. Oceanographic data, i.e., salinity, temperature, and nutrients, are used to link the trace metal results to the different water masses. The general range found is for cadmium, 0.5-0.8 nM; copper, 2.0-2.9 nM; cobalt, 20-40 nM; nickel, 6-7 nM; lead, 10 pM; zinc, 3-7 nM. The suspended trace metals are a small fraction, but considerably higher than in other oceans. The lowest concentrations of cadmium, copper, and zinc are found in the surface layer and in the whole water column at the Filchner Depression. Cobalt shows an increase in the surface water compared to the deep water. This is suggested to be generated by the terrogent material from the Antarctic continent from the melting of the ice. No evidence of anthropogenic lead can be seen in the lead profile. Nutrient trace metal relations found show poor statistical correlation in contrast to what is found in other oceans. This assumes that cadmium, copper, and zinc are not directly linked to the bioproduction cycle. However, the nutrient trace metal ratios found support the theory that the Weddell Sea is the ultimate source for generation of the nutrient trace metal ratios in the Pacific Ocean.},

abstract = {Sympatric speciation remains controversial. 'Sympatry' originally meant "in the same geographical area". Recently, evolutionists have redefined 'sympatric speciation' non-spatially to require panmixia (m = 0.5) between a pair of demes before onset of reproductive isolation. Although panmixia is a suitable starting point in models of speciation, it is not a useful definition of sympatry in natural populations, because it becomes virtually impossible to find or demonstrate sympatry in nature. The newer, non-spatial definition fails to address the classical debate about whether natural selection within a geographic overlap regularly causes speciation in nature, or whether complete geographic isolation is usually required. We therefore propose a more precise spatial definition by incorporating the population genetics of dispersal (or 'cruising range'). Sympatric speciation is considerably more likely under this spatial definition than under the demic definition, because distance itself has a powerful structuring effect, even over small spatial scales comparable to dispersal. Ecological adaptation in two-dimensional space often acts as a 'magic trait' that causes pleiotropic reductions of gene flow. We provide examples from our own research.},

Global climate change will exacerbate the challenges faced by the biodiversity of this region. In this review, we identify trends in characteristics for 305 terrestrial species threatened by climate change and severe weather according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). We then review the literature on observed and potential impacts of climate change on terrestrial biodiversity, focusing on the species' characteristics that were identified. High-elevation ecosystems such as cloud montane forests are projected to disappear entirely by the year 2100, with corresponding global losses of their endemic biodiversity. Sea level rise threatens restricted range species on small low-lying atolls. Shifts in distribution may be possible for generalist species, but range shifts will be difficult for species with small distributions, specialized habitat requirements, slow dispersal rates, and species at high elevations. Accurate assessments of climate change impacts on biodiversity of the region are difficult because of confusion about nomenclature, the many species unknown to science, the lack of baseline data on species' ecology and distributions, and lack of fine resolution elevation data for very small islands. Furthermore, synergistic interactions of climate change with other threats like habitat loss and invasive species have not been comprehensively assessed. Addressing these knowledge gaps will be difficult for Pacific island nations due to limited financial resources and expertise.},

abstract = {Twentieth century environmental lead chronologies for the western North Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans have been reconstructed from annually-banded scleractinian corals. Measurements of lattice-bound Pb in sequential coral bands reveal temporal changes in surface water Pb concentrations and Pb isotopic distributions. Perturbations are observable in all specimens studied, attesting to global augmentation of environmental Pb by industrialization. In the western North Atlantic, Pb perturbations have occurred in direct response to the American industrial revolution and the subsequent introduction and phasing-out of alkyl Pb additives in gasoline. Surface ocean conditions near Bermuda may be reliably reconstructed from the coral data via a lead distribution coefficient of 2.3 for the species, Diploria strigosa. Based on 210Pb measurements, a similar distribution coefficient may be characteristic of corals in general. Surface Pb concentrations in the pre-industrial Sargasso Sea were about 15-20 pM. Concentrations rose to near 90 pM by 1923 as a result of metals manufacture and fossil fuel combustion. Beginning in the late 1940's, increased utilization of leaded gasoline eventually led to a peak concentration of 240 pM in 1971, representing an approximate 15-fold increase over background. Surface ocean concentrations are presently declining rapidly (128 pM in 1984) as a result of curtailed alkyl Pb usage. Lead isotopic shifts parallel the concentration record indicating that characteristic industrial and alkyl Pb source signatures have not changed appreciably in time. Industrial releases recorded in the Florida Keys reflect a weaker source and evidence of recirculated Pb (5-6 years old) from the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. An inferred background concentration of 38 pM suggests influence of shelf and/or resuspended inputs of Pb to these coastal waters. In remote areas of the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, industrial signals are fainter and the corals studied much younger than their Atlantic counterparts. Contemporary Pb concentrations implied by coral measurements (assuming KD = 2.3) are 40-50 pM for surface waters near Tutuila and Galapagos in the South Pacific, and 25-29 pM near Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. A single coral band from Fiji (1920 ?? 5 yr) implies a pre-industrial surface water concentration of 16-19 pM Pb for the South Pacific. In view of reported surface water measurements and the North Atlantic coral data, the Pacific coral extrapolations may be slightly high. This could be a result of small variations in KD among different coral genera, or incorporation of diagenetic Pb by corals sampled in coastal environments. ?? 1987.},

abstract = {Whether the environmental benefits of emerging technologies are outweighed by the environmental impacts of producing and using scarce technology metals remains an open question. We present a three-level approach to assess how increasing environmental impacts on the resource provision level affect the overall impacts on the product level and on the service level, at an early stage of technology implementation. The approach is described based on a case example: we evaluate the environmental impacts of different supply options for lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) - required for the production of Li-ion batteries - and their influence on the environmental impacts associated with an electric vehicle (EV). We applied the methodology of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and considered the production of Li2CO3from three different deposit types: natural brines (currently dominant), ores (less common) and seawater (hypothetical future option). For each of the three supply options, we established an inventory dataset for both favorable and unfavorable processing conditions. The inventory datasets were combined with those used in a recently published LCA, which compared the environmental impacts of an EV with those of an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV). The results of this study indicate that the environmental impacts of Li2CO3production as a percentage of the total transportation impacts caused by an EV are currently negligible. Only if seawater was used under unfavorable processing conditions, these impacts could outweigh the environmental benefits of EV over an ICEV; however, the uncertainty is high due to the limited data availability regarding future lithium production processes. The break-even point for the environmental impacts of 1 km driven with an EV and with an ICEV would be reached only if the impacts per kilogram of Li2CO3were increased by about two orders of magnitude (more than 200 times higher for the impact assessment method Cumulative Energy Demand, about 450 times higher for Global Warming Potential and about 100 times higher for ecoindicator 99). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Alamo Breccia is a carbonate rock breccia of Late Devonian age in southern Nevada. It is an anomalous sedimentary unit because it has the properties of a massive debris-flow and turbidity-current deposit that would be expected to occur in deep water, but is intercalated over much of its area with typical shallow-water carbonate-platform beds. The Breccia was created by the catastrophic detachment and flow, over a nearly horizontal surface, of previously deposited platform carbonates. It crops out in 14 or more mountain ranges that cover an area of differs from 10,000 km (super 2) , conservatively averages differs from 50 m in thickness, and contains a volume of 500+ km (super 3) . Along the base it contains trains of individual detached blocks as much as 500 m long and 90 m high. Clasts generally grade upward to gravel-, sand-, or mud-sized particles at the top. The Breccia was generated by forces unleashed during the impact of an extraterrestrial object with Earth. The impact produced shocked quartz grains, unique ejecta spherules, and an iridium anomaly--which are present within the Breccia but absent from confining beds. Internally the Breccia is segmented vertically into as many as five sequentially thinner graded units created by successive tsunamis. In one range, peculiar deformed dolostone, shocked quartz sandstone, and sedimentary dikes and sills occur under the Breccia and deep-water limestones rest over it, indicating a near-crater location. Surrounding detached megablocks and tsunamites suggest an annular crater trough. The Breccia formed within the span of a few hours or days, and falls entirely within a single early Frasnian conodont zone, at differs from 367 Ma. The well-documented middle Late Devonian (Frasnian/Famennian) extinctions are differs from 3 Ma later. An impact scenario explains the known features of the Alamo Breccia: impact occurred on the Late Devonian outer platform or slope; seismic shock delaminated the upper differs from 50 to 100 m of the platform, loosening carbonate-platform bedrock and creating trains of large blocks that may rest in an annular trough; successive tsunamis reworked the loosened material, which was augmented by unknown proportions of ejecta containing shocked quartz from the crater, carbonate spherules from the vapor cloud, and iridium from the projectile. Mass flows west of the platform likely represent tsunami backwash, shock-induced failure along the platform margin, and slumps from offshore topographic highs.},

Except for Hg, the geographical distribution of mean concentrations of 226Ra, U and stable heavy metals in contemporary ice is not uniform, with the lowest concentrations found in Northern Norway, Alaska and Antarctica, and the highest in continental locations at equatorial and middle latitudes. We did not find evidence of changes in rate of metal deposition during the last three decades, as compared with pre-industrial period, however, our samples of pre-industrial ice might be contaminated in part by contemporary fallout migrating from the exposed surface of old parts of glaciers into the deeper ice layers. Using the data on annual injections of 137Cs into the global atmosphere and mean global concentrations of radionuclides and heavy metals found in contemporary ice the global annual flows of 226Ra, 210Pb, U,V, Pb, Cd and Hg were estimated as 6.6 kCi, 485 kCi, 12kt, 4870kt, 590 kt, 180 kt and 190 kt, respectively. These estimates are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than estimates based on primary paniculate emissions.

abstract = {The geochemical behaviour of dissolved trace elements in sediment interstitial waters from the Vigo Ria (Galicia, Spain) has been determined. Dissolved concentrations in the pore waters ranged between 1.7-23.2??nM for Co, 1.5-131??nM for Cu, 19.5-159??nM for Ni, 0.02-19.3??nM for Pb, 5.4-260??nM for V and 0.2-241??nM for Zn. Values for Cu, Pb and Zn were highest along the axis of the ria, whereas Co, Ni, V and Zn were more abundant in the area of the industrialised shipyards. The metal profiles were affected by sedimentary redox processes, which were monitored by means of Mn and Fe concentrations and pore water pH. Dissolved Cu and V had relatively high concentrations in the oxic surface layer and their concentrations decreased with depth, although in deeper layers concentrations of V increased in association with the presence of dissolved organic ligands. Cobalt and Ni followed the behaviour of Mn, although they were depleted in surface oxic layers their concentrations increased in the Mn reduction zone. Lead and Zn had highly irregular profiles because of their lower redox-sensitivity and their complexation with organic material is not as pronounced as that for Cu. Dissolved metal concentrations in overlying waters oscillated between 0.7-2.1??nM for Co, 5.5-50.5??nM for Cu, 4.6-10.0??nM for Ni, 1.4-9.1 for Pb, 5.7-28.5??nM for V and 14.6-66.5??nM for Zn. Using Fick's first law of diffusion, the benthic fluxes of the elements varied between 0.03-0.24??nmol cm- 2 y- 1 for Co, (- 0.02)-1.11??nmol cm- 2 y- 1 for Cu, 0.16-1.70??nmol cm- 2 y- 1 for Ni, (-0.14)-0.03??nmol cm- 2 y- 1 for Pb, 1.52-4.35??nmol cm- 2 y- 1 for V and (- 0.37)-0.90??nmol cm- 2 y- 1 for Zn. Fluxes were higher in the ria axis for Cu, Ni, V and Zn and in the shipyard area for Co, while Pb fluxes were negligible at all the stations. This work has demonstrated that the redox geochemistry and diagenetic processes of the sediments and pore waters control the benthic fluxes in the Vigo Ria. When the upper layer of the sediment is oxic a high exportation of Cu and V to the overlying waters occurs and during less oxidizing conditions of this layer, Ni and Co exportation from the pore water increases. Dissolved trace metal benthic fluxes to the Vigo Ria were significant for most of the metals (Cu, Ni and V) and were of the same order of magnitude to the riverine inputs. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Dissolved lead (Pb) concentrations and isotope ratios in seawater of the Western Philippine Sea (WPS) were determined to investigate sources of Pb in the region. Surface seawater concentrations at seven sampling stations ranged from 36.2 to 68.1??pmol??kg?????1. Isotopic composition of surface water, with 206Pb/207Pb ranging from 1.162 to 1.170, 208Pb/207Pb ranging from 2.445 to 2.451, and 206Pb/204Pb ranging from 18.14 to 18.27, reflects Asian anthropogenic aerosols input to the WPS. Shallow water Pb concentrations within the Kuroshio Current domain are about 15??pmol kg?????1 lower than at other sites and, together with a distinct isotopic signature (206Pb/207Pb??=??1.167???1.170, 208Pb/207Pb??=??2.447???2.451 and 206Pb/204Pb??=??18.22???18.27), reflect water originating from the Equatorial Pacific that is relatively less impacted by contamination from anthropogenic inputs. An isotopically distinct sub-surface Pb maximum at about 100 to 250??m, representing water originating from the Western North Pacific where anthropogenic Pb deposition is high, was seen at all seven sites. Lead concentrations in deep water in the stations further from shore are typically lower than in the surface layer and ranged from 11.2 to 51.6??pmol??kg?????1. Lead isotopic signatures in deep water at these sites (206Pb/207Pb??=??1.162???1.184; 208Pb/207Pb??=??2.448???2.471; 206Pb/204Pb??=??18.13???18.51) are offset from pre-anthropogenic values and suggest that anthropogenic sources have penetrated the deep water column. Elevated concentrations and isotopic signatures observed in the deep water at stations closer to shore, where sediment transport is prevalent, indicate that sedimentary input is a major source of dissolved Pb at these sites. Differences in Pb concentrations and isotopic signatures between samples collected from the Pacific Deep Water (PDW) water-mass during this study and those collected a decade ago suggest that Pb inputs even in deep water change on decadal scales.},

abstract = {Fluxes of trace metals across the sediment-water interface were measured in situ at 6 m depth in Gullmarsfjorden, Sweden, using diver-operated stirred benthic flux-chambers. These were equipped so that dissolved oxygen and pH could be maintained near ambient seawater values (regulated chamber) or be allowed to change in response to benthic respiration (unregulated chamber). In the regulated chamber, Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn were released from the sediment at constant rates both during a winter experiment (water temperature -1 ∞C) and during a fall experiment (+ 10∞C). During the fall experiment, fluxes (in nmol m-2 d-1) of 13 (Cd), 118 (Cu), 209 (Ni), and 1400 (Zn) were measured. In winter, the release rates were lower by factors of 5 and 10 for Cu and Ni but not significantly different for Cd and Zn. Neither release nor uptake by the sediment could be demonstrated for Pb. The pore-water in a diver-collected core was depleted in Cd, Cu, and Zn and slightly enriched in Ni and Pb, relative to the ambient seawater. There was no correspondence between fluxes calculated from porewater profiles and actually measured fluxes; nor could the fluxes be directly related to the degradation rate of organic matter. In the unregulated chamber, initial trace metal release rates were lower than in the regulated chamber. As the oxygen concentration decreased, the metal fluxes decreased as well and were ultimately reversed as sulfide began to appear in the water. The fluxes of trace metals are sensitive to the oxygen regime in the flux chamber because the solubilization of these metals, which takes place in a thin oxic layer near the sediment surface, depends on the oxygen flux across the sediment-water interface.},

abstract = {The electrification of our world is driving a strong increase in demand for lithium. Energy storage is paramount in electric and hybrid vehicles, in green but intermittent energy sources, and in smart grids in general. Lithium is a vital raw material for the build-up of both currently available lithium-ion batteries, and prospective next generation batteries such as lithium-air and lithium sulphur. The continued availability of lithium can only rely on a strong increase of mining and ore processing. It would be an inconsistency if the increased production of lithium for a more sustainable society would be associated with non-sustainable mining practices. Currently 2/3 of the world production of lithium is extracted from brines, a practice that evaporates on average half a million litres of brine per ton of lithium carbonate. Furthermore, the extraction is chemical intensive, extremely slow, and delivers large volumes of waste. This technology is heavily dependent on the geological structure of the deposits, brine chemical composition and both climate and weather conditions. Therefore, it is difficult to adapt from one successful exploitation to new deposits. A few years of simulations and piloting are needed before large scale production is achieved. Consequently, this technology is struggling with the current surge in demand. At time of writing, only 5 industrial scale facilities are in operation worldwide, highlighting the shortcomings in this technology. Both mining companies and academics are intensively searching for new technologies for lithium recovery from brines. However, focus on the chemistry of brine processing has left unattended the analysis of the sustainability of the overall process. Here we review both the current available technology and new proposed methodologies. We make a special focus on an overall sustainability analysis, with particular emphasis to the geological characteristics of deposits and water usage in relation to mining processes.},

abstract = {The lower and greater part of the Lias Group of the Hebrides Basin comprises shallow-marine to marginal-marine mudstones, siltstones, sandstones and limestones arranged in unambiguous transgressive-regressive facies cycles. In the northern region of the basin, the strata were deposited in a series of half graben bounded on their western margins by major eastward-dipping normal faults developed principally during the Triassic. Interpretation of the palaeogeographic setting of the lower Lias is complicated because exposure of the sequences occurs in the vicinity of transfer zones that have subsequently acted as foci for Palaeocene igneous activity. The principal exposures have been measured or remeasured in this study, and detailed sedimentary logs are presented that incorporate previously unpublished ammonite determinations. In the northern part of the Inner Hebrides Trough (Skye-Pabay-Raasay area), two formations are recognized: the Broadford Formation and the Pabay Shale Formation. The Broadford Formation, as used in this study, is equivalent only to the 'Lower Broadford Beds' of previous authors. The Pabay Shale incorporates the former 'Upper Broadford Beds' and 'Pabba Shale' of previous usage. Two new predominantly arenaceous members of the Pabay Shale Formation are formally defined for the northern area: the Hallaig Sandstone Member (Lower Sinemurian; Semicostatum - Turneri Zones) occurs within the lower Pabay Shale and has its type locality at Hallaig Waterfall on Raasay; the Suisnish Sandstone Member (Upper Sinemurian - Lower Pliensbachian; Raricostatum - Jamesoni zones) occupies the middle part of the Pabay Shale Formation and has its type locality at Rubha Suisnish and in the cliffs along the southern shore of Loch Eishort, on Skye. In the southern area (Mull-Morvern) use of the terms 'Lower Broadford Beds' or 'Upper Broadford Beds' is also inappropriate. In Ardnamurchan, and to a limited extent in more northerly exposures, the Broadford Formation interdigitates with its more southerly offshore equivalent, the Blue Lias Formation. The Pabay Shale of the Ardnamurchan - Morvern - Mull area is recognized down to the junction with the Blue Lias. A sandstone unit is well developed at about the Lower Sinemurian - Upper Sinemurian boundary: it is here named the Torosay Sandstone Member of the Pabay Shale Formation and is incompletely exposed at several localities on the southeastern coast of Mull. Although no age-diagnostic fossils have been found within the sandstone, it must lie within the upper Obtusum Zone to lower Raricostatum Zone interval. Overall, there is a general trend from more proximal environments of deposition in the north and east, towards more distal environments in the south and west. This regional pattern is modulated by the localized occurrence of sand-rich, very proximal successions in the vicinity of the supposed transfer zones, such as the area immediately SE of the northern termination of the Camasunary Fault. Records from the Upper Glen-1 borehole, in NW Skye, show that the expanded lower Lias sequence in the centre of the Sea of the Hebrides - Little Minch Basin can be subdivided in a similar manner to that exposed in the Inner Hebrides Trough; for example, it shows the development of more sandy strata at about the Lower Sinemurian to Upper Sinemurian boundary. Like the Ardnamurchan section, it also shows an intercalation of the Broadford Formation and Blue Lias. The upper half of the Pabay Shale appears to be truncated in the borehole: it is debatable whether this resulted from erosion prior to deposition of the Scalpa Sandstone, from sediment starvation or, alternatively, intersection of the borehole by a normal fault.},

Our mean values for Cu, Mn, Co and Pb are similar to the UCC; Zn, Ni and Cr are more highly enriched, compared to UCC values.

abstract = {Assessments of inorganic elemental speciation in seawater span the past four decades. Experimentation, compilation and critical review of equilibrium data over the past forty years have, in particular, considerably improved our understanding of cation hydrolysis and the complexation of cations by carbonate ions in solution. Through experimental investigations and critical evaluation it is now known that more than forty elements have seawater speciation schemes that are strongly influenced by pH. In the present work, the speciation of the elements in seawater is summarized in a manner that highlights the significance of pH variations. For elements that have pH-dependent species concentration ratios, this work summarizes equilibrium data (S = 35, t = 25°C) that can be used to assess regions of dominance and relative species concentrations. Concentration ratios of complex species are expressed in the form log[A]/[B] = pH - C where brackets denote species concentrations in solution, A and B are species important at higher (A) and lower (B) solution pH, and C is a constant dependent on salinity, temperature and pressure. In the case of equilibria involving complex oxy-anions (MOx(OH)y) or hydroxy complexes (M(OH)n), C is written as pK n = -log K n or pK n* = -log K n* respectively, where K n and K n* are equilibrium constants. For equilibria involving carbonate complexation, the constant C is written as pQ = -log(K 2 l K n [HCO3 -]) where K 2 l is the HCO3 - dissociation constant, K n is a cation complexation constant and [HCO3 -] is approximated as 1.9 × 10-3 molar. Equilibrium data expressed in this manner clearly show dominant species transitions, ranges of dominance, and relative concentrations at any pH.},

The resulting data reveal aspects of the earthquake process never before seen. Here we show what these data, when combined with data from earlier Parkfield earthquakes, tell us about earthquake physics and earthquake prediction. The 2004 Parkfield earthquake, with its lack of obvious precursors, demonstrates that reliable short-term earthquake prediction still is not achievable. To reduce the societal impact of earthquakes now, we should focus on developing the next generation of models that can provide better predictions of the strength and location of damaging ground shaking.},

abstract = {With a surface area of about 10,000 km2, the Salar de Uyuni is the largest salt flat in the world. It is located at an altitude of 3,653 m on the Altiplano, a high plateau in the south of the Bolivian Andes. The Salar de Uyuni consists of an alternating sequence of highly porous salt layers (mainly composed of halite) and lacustrine clay sediments. The pore volume of the uppermost salt layer which has a thickness of up to 11 m is filled by brine. The brine contains high amounts of Mg, K, Li and B. The element lithium is an especially important raw material for the production of batteries. Thus, it plays an important role for the development of the electric mobility. With this background, extensive hydrogeological exploration activities were carried out at the Salar de Uyuni in the context of this dissertation. The hydraulic properties of the uppermost salt crust and the physical properties (density and viscosity) of the brine must be characterized. In order to do this, several core drillings were made, observation wells were installed, brine samples were taken and pumping tests were conducted between 2009 and 2012. The stratigraphic documentation of the obtained sediment cores provided insights about the deposit structure and the upper salt layer thickness. The determination of the salt core porosity was carried out by three different methods: (a) by using X-ray computed tomography, (b) gravimetrically by saturation with 2-octanol and (c) by completion of the core volume with plasticine and calculation of the porosity under consideration of the particle density of the salt. The laboratory investigations showed a depth-dependent porosity distribution in the upper salt layer. The uppermost 2 m were characterized by very high porosity values between 30 and 39{\%}. However at greater depth, the total porosity decreases on average to 13.5{\%}. Geochemical analyses of brine samples confirmed the general spatial distribution of the lithium concentrations as already published by previous studies. On the basis of the lithium distribution in the brine, the thickness of the upper salt layer and the depth-dependent porosity distribution, the total lithium deposit in the Salar de Uyuni was calculated to be about 7 million tons. The evaluation of the pumping tests under consideration of the density and viscosity of the pumped brine showed that the salt has a very high permeability in the horizontal direction. In contrast, flow-through experiments on drill cores indicated a clear vertical anisotropy of the permeability. This is caused by the inhomogeneous sediment stratification for instance by interbedded fine gypsum or clay lamina. Thus, horizontal brine movements are possible, but a deep vertical flow component can hardly be expected. This assumption is confirmed by radiocarbon dating the brine samples from different salt depths. The influence of annual floods during the rainy season could be observed by long-term brine level measurements. Throughout the time-series analysis, distinct periodic brine fluctuations of a few centimeters per day could be identified during the dry season. These daily fluctuations indicated an impermeable crust probably formed by the evaporation of near-surface brine and subsequent crystallization of salts in the pore volume. Thus, daily temperature and atmospheric pressure changes could directly affect the brine level. Due to the extensive hydrogeological investigations, this dissertation contributes to the essential understanding of the hydraulic conditions in the Salar de Uyuni. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {A localized Lower Ordovician, early Caledonian structural event ("Sardic phase") is recorded in SW Sardinia by an angular and erosional unconformity, faulting, and mild folding. This event was accompanied by sedimentation of a transgressive, clastic unit ("Puddinga Beds") which is particularly well developed along a major fault system (Gonnesa fault zone). There, the "Puddinga Beds" range from basal interfingering fans (some formed by coarse carbonate and schist-clasts others by schist-clasts only), to fluvio-lacustrine mud and gravelly sandstone, to coastal muddy and sandy deposits, and to fossiliferous restricted marine shelf sediments. The existence of the slightly compressive "Sardic phase" in SW Sardinia and quasi-coeval calc-alkaline volcanism and an extensional structural phase ("Sarrabese phase") in central-east Sardinia, suggest transcurrent faulting. The calc-alkaline acid volcanism is also interpreted by some authors to indicate that the rifted basins developed in backarc position. The non-volcanic sequence of SW Sardinia analyzed in this paper was probably formed in basins developed on the northern margin of the Gondwanaland craton. This Sardinian system may be the eastward extension of transcurrent rifts which have also been recently reported from NW Spain. Structural activity has been the predominant control on sedimentation; however, worldwide, recurring, low sea-level stands may have influenced the sedimentation of the lower part of the "Puddinga Beds", and the deglaciation of the Saharan Ice Sheet has contributed to the uppermost Ordovician-early Silurian deepening of the euxinic shelf. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Recent research in the ‘‘crime at places'' literature is concerned with smaller units of analysis than conventional spatial criminology. An important issue is whether the spatial patterns observed in conventional spatial crim- inology focused on neighborhoods remain when the analysis shifts to street segments. In this article, the authors use a new spatial point pattern test that identifies the similarity in spatial point patterns. This test is local in nature such that the output can be mapped showing where differences are present. Using this test, the authors investigate the stability of crime patterns moving from census tracts to dissemination areas to street segments. The authors find that general crime patterns are somewhat similar at all spatial scales, but finer scales of analysis reveal significant variations within larger units. This result demonstrates the importance of analyzing crime patterns at small scales and has important implications for further theoretical development and policy implementation.},

abstract = {This study provides a comprehensive and quantitative discussion of the inventory and mass balance of dissolved thallium (Tl) in the oceans. The calculations are based on a critical evaluation of recently published analytical data. Thallium is estimated to have a mean seawater concentration of 65 pmol/kg and this implies a total oceanic inventory of about 8.76??104 Mmol Tl. The five primary sources of dissolved Tl in the oceans are rivers, hydrothermal fluids, eolian contributions from volcanic emanations and mineral aerosols, and benthic fluxes from continental margin sediments. Combined, these sources generate a Tl flux of between 1.4 and 12 Mmol/year, with a best estimate of 5.2 Mmol/year. Based on this, an oceanic residence time of 7-63 ky is calculated for Tl, with a best estimate of 17 ky. The two main oceanic sinks of Tl are scavenging from seawater by the authigenic phases of pelagic clays and uptake of Tl during low-temperature alteration of oceanic crust. These sinks remove about 1.6-7.7 Mmol/year of Tl, with a best estimate of 4.2 Mmol/year. This indicates an oceanic residence time of 11-56 ky, with a best estimate of 21 ky. The mass balance yields input and output fluxes which are identical, within the uncertainties, and this is in accord with a budget that is in steady state. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

More than a million people live under this ash plume, and there is considerable concern about the possible effects of this on their health. We have studied the physicochemical characteristics and in vitro effects of airborne ash collected at 8 km from the crater. More than 30{\%} of the ash was found to be SiO 2 (w/w) with most of the particles within the respirable size range. The ash did not inhibit the colony formation of V79–4 cells and failed to activate complement or generate chemotactic factor activity in sampies of fresh human serum. It was minimally active in causing the release of lysosomal enzymes from human neutrophile, and did not cause arachidonic acid release from macrophage‐like cells. These results were in accord with our epidemiological study, in which very low prevalences of nonspecific respiratory diseases were demonstrated even at the area with highest ash exposure. },

abstract = {The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) is a major custodian of one of the ocean's major natural resources: tuna. The commercial tuna fisheries sector is the most important economic sector in the RMI and is thus a substantial contributor to this tiny island nation's GDP. Tuna catch and its associated revenues has fluctuated in line with climatic events such as the El Ni{\~{n}}o/La Ni{\~{n}}a Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and, in the last decade, national fisheries development policies have begun to capitalize on the positive effects that ENSO warm events have had on the tuna populations. However, global warming is expected to have a significant impact on ENSO, and not necessarily in positive ways. This paper will focus on the relationship between environment and economic development in the RMI fisheries sector. In particular, the linkages between global warming and its effects on the tuna fisheries sector must be better understood and uncertainties accounted for so that impacts are appropriately addressed and integrated into sustainable fisheries development policies. Conclusions reached are that new fisheries development strategies that emphasize environmental-based planning are required. The emerging ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management is a start, as are the various international initiatives in furthering our understanding of the linkages between climate and ocean systems currently underway. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Author.

abstract = {Hydrogenetic ferromanganese oxyhydroxide crusts (Fe-Mn crusts) precipitate out of cold ambient ocean water onto hard-rock surfaces (seamounts, plateaus, ridges) at water depths of about 400 to 4000 m throughout the ocean basins. The slow-growing (mm/Ma) Fe-Mn crusts concentrate most elements above their mean concentration in the Earth's crust. Tellurium is enriched more than any other element (up to about 50,000 times) relative to its Earth's crustal mean of about 1 ppb, compared with 250 times for the next most enriched element. We analyzed the Te contents for a suite of 105 bulk hydrogenetic crusts and 140 individual crust layers from the global ocean. For comparison, we analyzed 10 hydrothermal stratabound Mn-oxide samples collected from a variety of tectonic environments in the Pacific. In the Fe-Mn crust samples, Te varies from 3 to 205 ppm, with mean contents for Pacific and Atlantic samples of about 50 ppm and a mean of 39 ppm for Indian crust samples. Hydrothermal Mn samples have Te contents that range from 0.06 to 1 ppm. Continental margin Fe-Mn crusts have lower Te contents than open-ocean crusts, which is the result of dilution by detrital phases and differences in growth rates of the hydrogenetic phases. Correlation coefficient matrices show that for hydrothermal deposits, Te has positive correlations with elements characteristic of detrital minerals. In contrast, Te in open-ocean Fe-Mn crusts usually correlates with elements characteristic of the MnO2, carbonate fluorapatite, and residual biogenic phases. In continental margin crusts, Te also correlates with FeOOH associated elements. In addition, Te is negatively correlated with water depth of occurrence and positively correlated with crust thickness. Q-mode factor analyses support these relationships. However, sequential leaching results show that most of the Te is associated with FeOOH in Fe-Mn crusts and ≤10{\%} is leached with the MnO2. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that Te occurs predominantly as H5TeO6-in ocean water. The speciation of Te in ocean water and charge balance considerations indicate that Te should be scavenged by FeOOH, which is in agreement with our leaching results. The thermodynamically more stable Te(IV) is less abundant by factors of 2 to 3.5 than Te(VI) in ocean water. This can be explained by preferential (not exclusive) scavenging of Te(IV) by FeOOH at the Fe-Mn crust surface and by Fe-Mn colloids in the water column. We propose a model in which the extreme enrichment of Te in Fe-Mn crusts is likely the result of an oxidation reaction on the surface of FeOOH. A similar oxidation process has been confirmed for Co, Ce, and Tl at the surface of MnO2in crusts, but has not been suggested previously to occur in association with FeOOH in Fe-Mn crusts. Mass-balance considerations indicate that ocean floor Fe-Mn deposits are the major sink for Te in the oceans. The concentration and redox chemistry of Te in the global ocean are likely controlled by scavenging on Fe-Mn colloids in the water column and Fe-Mn deposits on the ocean floor, as is also the case for Ce. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Animals living within seismically active regions are subjected episodically to intense ground shaking that can kill individuals through burrow collapse, egg destruction, and tsunami action. Although anecdotal and retrospective reports of animal behavior suggest that although many organisms may be able to detect an impending seismic event, no plausible scenario has been presented yet through which accounts for the evolution of such behaviors. The evolutionary mechanism of exaptation can do this in a two-step process. The first step is to evolve a vibration-triggered early warning response which would act in the short time interval between the arrival of P and S waves. Anecdotal evidence suggests this response already exists. Then if precursory stimuli also exist, similar evolutionary processes can link an animal{\&}{\#}039;s perception of these stimuli to its P-wave triggered response, yielding an earthquake predictive behavior. A population-genetic model indicates that such a seismic-escape response system can be maintained against random mutations as a result of episodic selection that operates with time scales comparable to that of strong seismic events. Hence, additional understanding of possible earthquake precursors that are presently outside the realm of seismology might be gleaned from the study of animal behavior, sensory physiology, and genetics. A brief review of possible seismic precursors suggests that tilt, hygroreception (humidity), electric, and magnetic sensory systems in animals could be linked into a seismic escape behavioral system. Several testable predictions of this analysis are discussed, and it is recommended that additional magnetic, electrical, tilt, and hygro-sensors be incorporated into dense monitoring networks in seismically active regions.

The fossil record illuminates their transitions from land to sea, yet these initial invasions account for a small proportion of their evolutionary history. We review the history of marine invasions that drove major changes in anatomy, physiology, and ecology over more than 250 million years. Many innovations evolved convergently in multiple clades, whereas others are unique to individual lineages. The evolutionary arcs of these ecologically important clades are framed against the backdrop of mass extinctions and regime shifts in ocean ecosystems. Past and present human disruptions to marine tetrapods, with cascading impacts on marine ecosystems, underscore the need to link macroecology with evolutionary change.},

abstract = {A new method for the determination of seawater Pb isotope compositions and concentrations was developed, which combines and optimizes previously published protocols for the separation and isotopic analysis of this element. For isotopic analysis, the procedure involves initial separation of Pb from 1 to 2L of seawater by co-precipitation with Mg hydroxide and further purification by a two stage anion exchange procedure. The Pb isotope measurements are subsequently carried out by thermal ionization mass spectrometry using a 207Pb-204Pb double spike for correction of instrumental mass fractionation. These methods are associated with a total procedural Pb blank of 28??21pg (1sd) and typical Pb recoveries of 40-60{\%}. The Pb concentrations are determined by isotope dilution (ID) on 50mL of seawater, using a simplified version of above methods. Analyses of multiple aliquots of six seawater samples yield a reproducibility of about ??1 to ??10{\%} (1sd) for Pb concentrations of between 7 and 50pmol/kg, where precision was primarily limited by the uncertainty of the blank correction (12??4pg; 1sd). For the Pb isotope analyses, typical reproducibilities (??2sd) of 700-1500ppm and 1000-2000ppm were achieved for 207Pb/206Pb, 208Pb/206Pb and 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb, respectively. These results are superior to literature data that were obtained using plasma source mass spectrometry and they are at least a factor of five more precise for ratios involving the minor 204Pb isotope. Both Pb concentration and isotope data, furthermore, show good agreement with published results for two seawater intercomparison samples of the GEOTRACES program. Finally, the new methods were applied to a seawater depth profile from the eastern South Atlantic. Both Pb contents and isotope compositions display a smooth evolution with depth, and no obvious outliers. Compared to previous Pb isotope data for seawater, the 206Pb/204Pb ratios are well correlated with 207Pb/206Pb, underlining the significant improvement achieved in the measurement of the minor 204Pb isotope.},

Mass balance calculations were employed to assess nuclide exchange rates at the dissolved-small particle interface and between small and large particles, and to quantify export with settling large particles. In the surface ocean, {\textless}sup{\textgreater}210{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Po scavenging is linearly correlated with the concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC) in large particles, supporting the role of biogenic particle in {\textless}sup{\textgreater}210{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Po bioaccumulation and export. In stations near the coast, this link is more complex due to the variable source of biogenic material and temporal changes in the surface biogeochemical and physical conditions. At depth, {\textless}sup{\textgreater}210{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Po exhibits significant widespread deficit with respect to {\textless}sup{\textgreater}210{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb that could in part be attributed to in situ {\textless}sup{\textgreater}210{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Po scavenging and may be related to surface biological productivity.

At depth, {\textless}sup{\textgreater}210{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb scavenging increases with depth and eastward due to the increase of adsorption sites available in the benthic layers and to a regional contribution of benthic {\textless}sup{\textgreater}210{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb scavenging and/or particle flux, respectively. The benthic nepheloid layer (BNL) and the Hydrothermal TAG plume distinctly enhance {\textless}sup{\textgreater}210{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Pb scavenging due to increased surface adsorption in association with resuspended or freshly formed particles. In contrast, {\textless}sup{\textgreater}210{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Po is not seen to be significantly scavenged in these environments due to its relatively short half-life and the long residence time of particles.},

abstract = {The arid northern regions of Chile are characterized by an intensive mineral mining industry and high solar irradiance levels. Besides Chile's main mining products, copper, molybdenum and iron, the production of lithium carbonate from lithium containing brines has become strategically important due to the rising demand for battery technologies worldwide. Its energy-intensive production may affect the ecological footprint of the product and the country's climate targets. Thus, the use of solar technologies for electricity and heat production might constitute an interesting option for CO 2 mitigation. This study aims to quantify the impacts of the lithium carbonate production processes in Chile on climate change, and to identify site-specific integration options of solar energy technologies to reduce GHG life-cycle emissions. The considered solar integration options include a parabolic trough power plant with a molten salt storage, a solar tower power plant with molten salt receiver and molten salt storage, a one-axis tracking photovoltaic energy system for electricity, and two solar thermal power plants with Ruths storage (steam accumulator) for thermal heat production. CSP plants were identified as measures with the highest GHG mitigation potential reducing the CO 2 emissions for the entire production chain and the lithium production between 16{\%} and 33{\%}. In a scenario that combines solar technologies for electricity and thermal energy generation, up to 59{\%} of the CO 2 emissions at the lithium production sites in Chile can be avoided. A comparison of the GHG abatement costs of the proposed solar integration options indicates that the photovoltaic system, the solar thermal plant with limited storage and the solar tower power plant are the most cost effective options.},

abstract = {We measured Pb isotopic composition and concentration in sediment samples close to the sea water interface in 6 box-cores from the NE Atlantic, 2 box-cores from the Sargasso Sea, and one from the US continental shelf. The anthropogenic Pb input to marine sediments due to the increase of Pb contamination over the ocean during the last century can be identified in all these cores. In the eastern part of the Atlantic, i.e., in regions under aeolian influence from Europe, Pb pollution can be recognized using its distinctive unradiogenic composition, clearly different from the upper-crustal values commonly found in pre-Holocene sediments. In contrast, Pb pollution in regions influenced by North American sources can be identified only in detailed concentration profiles because the American Pb pollution has an isotopic composition much closer to that of the natural detrital Pb input coming from weathering of the continental crust. Pb excess inventories are in good agreement with fluxes estimated from sedimenttrap data and with the time record of Pb-contamination increase given by analyses in coral growth bands. Inventories of Pb contamination to the sediments of the Mud Patch (American shelf) are tenfold higher (84 ??g/cm2) than those to Hatteras and Bermuda abyssal plains (4.3 and 2.8 ??g/cm2). ?? 1990.},

Specifically, the component of benthic discharge flux forced by the terrestrial hydraulic gradient is 0.8 m(3) d(-1); components of benthic discharge and recharge flux associated with the groundwater tidal prism are both 2.1 m(3) d(-1); components of benthic discharge and recharge flux forced by surface-gravity wave setup are both 6.3 m(3) d(-1); the component of benthic discharge flux that transports radium-228 is 350 m(3) d(-1); and components of benthic discharge and recharge flux forced by surface-gravity waves propagating over a porous medium are both 1400 m(3) d(-1). (All models are normalized per meter shoreline.) Benthic flux is a function of components forced by individual mechanisms and nonlinear interactions that exist between components. Constructive and destructive interference may enhance or diminish the contribution of benthic flux components. It may not be possible to model benthic flux by summing component magnitudes. Geochemical tracer techniques may not accurately model benthic discharge flux or submarine groundwater discharge (SGD).

This small concentration (0{\textperiodcentered}01 nM) of colloidal Pb may be attributed to the low amount of organic carbon associated with colloid size fraction as determined by dissolved organic carbon analyses. The chemical speciation of lead was determined in the dissolved sample and ultrafiltered sub-sample. Differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) on a thin mercury film (TMF) rotating glassy carbon disk electrode (RGCDE) was used to distinguish the kinetically labile inorganic species (Pb') from the Pb-chelated by organic ligands (PbLi). Lead titration results were similar for both samples revealing that Pb', PbLiand excess unbound ligands were present primarily in the ultrafiltrate, rather than in the colloidal phase. The titration data can be interpreted as dissolved Pb being influenced by two classes of Pb-binding ligands. In the dissolved sample, the concentration of the stronger class of ligands was [L1]=0{\textperiodcentered}89±0{\textperiodcentered}35 nM, with a conditional stability constant ofKcondL1,Pb'=3±1×1010M-1. The weaker class was [L2]=12{\textperiodcentered}8±1{\textperiodcentered}9 nM, withKcondL1,Pb'=4±1×108  M-1. The presence of these ligands, in excess of the dissolved Pb, resulted in [Pb']=7±2 pM and [Pb2+]=0{\textperiodcentered}3 pM (62 pg l-1).

abstract = {Hotspot mapping is a popular analytical technique that is used to help identify where to target police and crime reduction resources. In essence, hotspot mapping is used as a basic form of crime prediction, relying on retrospective data to identify the areas of high concentrations of crime and where policing and other crime reduction resources should be deployed. A number of different mapping techniques are used for identifying hotspots of crime-point mapping, thematic mapping of geographic areas (e. g. Census areas), spatial ellipses, grid thematic mapping and kernel density estimation (KDE). Several research studies have discussed the use of these methods for identifying hotspots of crime, usually based on their ease of use and ability to spatially interpret the location, size, shape and orientation of clusters of crime incidents. Yet surprising, very little research has compared how hotspot mapping techniques can accurately predict where crimes will occur in the future. This research uses crime data for a period before a fixed date (that has already passed) to generate hotspot maps, and test their accuracy for predicting where crimes will occur next. Hotspot mapping accuracy is compared in relation to the mapping technique that is used to identify concentrations of crime events (thematic mapping of Census Output Areas, spatial ellipses, grid thematic mapping, and KDE) and by crime type-four crime types are compared (burglary, street crime, theft from vehicles and theft of vehicles). The results from this research indicate that crime hotspot mapping prediction abilities differ between the different techniques and differ by crime type. KDE was the technique that consistently outperformed the others, while street crime hotspot maps were consistently better at predicting where future street crime would occur when compared to results for the hotspot maps of different crime types. The research offers the opportunity to benchmark comparative research of other techniques and other crime types, including comparisons between advanced spatial analysis techniques and prediction mapping methods. Understanding how hotspot mapping can predict spatial patterns of crime and how different mapping methods compare will help to better inform their application in practice.

abstract = {Tsunami waves can produce four general categories of depositional and erosional signa-tures that differentiate them from storm waves. Combinations of items from these categories uniquely define the impact of palaeo-tsunami on the coastal landscape. The largest palaeo-tsunami waves in Australia swept sediment across the continental shelf and obtained flow depths of 15–20 m at the coastline with velocities in excess of 10 m s −1 . In New South Wales, along the cliffs of Jervis Bay, waves reached elevations of more than 80 m above sea-level with evidence of flow depths in excess of 10 m. These waves swept 10 km inland over the Shoalhaven delta. In northern Queensland, boulders more than 6 m in diameter and weighing 286 tonnes were tossed alongshore above cyclone storm wave limits inside the Great Barrier Reef. In Western Australia waves overrode and breached 60 m high hills up to 5 km inland. Shell debris and cobbles can be found within deposits mapped as dunes, 30 km inland. The array of signatures provide directional information about the origin of the tsunami and, when combined with radiocarbon dating, indicate that at least one and maybe two catastrophic events have occurred during the last 1000 years along these three coasts. Only the West Australian coast has historically been affected by notable tsunami with maximum run-up elevations of 4–6 m. Palaeo-tsunami have been an order of magnitude greater than this. These palaeo-tsunami are produced most likely by large submarine slides on the continental slope or the impact of meteorites with the adjacent ocean.},

abstract = {AbstractOpenStreetMap (OSM) data are widely used but their reliability is still variable. Many contributors to OSM have not been trained in geography or surveying and consequently their contributions, including geometry and attribute data inserts, deletions, and updates, can be inaccurate, incomplete, inconsistent, or vague. There are some mechanisms and applications dedicated to discovering bugs and errors in OSM data. Such systems can remove errors through user-checks and applying predefined rules but they need an extra control process to check the real-world validity of suspected errors and bugs. This paper focuses on finding bugs and errors based on patterns and rules extracted from the tracking data of users. The underlying idea is that certain characteristics of user trajectories are directly linked to the type of feature. Using such rules, some sets of potential bugs and errors can be identified and stored for further investigations.},

abstract = {Natural Pb-isotope variability in the oceans encodes information about the sources of continental material to the oceans, about ocean circulation, and about Pb removal. In order to use this information, we must understand the natural cycle of Pb in the oceans, which is overprinted by large anthropogenic input. In this study we use 210 Pb, which has not been significantly anthropogenically perturbed, to investigate oceanic Pb. GEOSECS 226 Ra and model-derived atmospheric fluxes of 210 Pb are used to input 210 Pb into an ocean general circulation model. Irreversible scavenging of this 210 Pb onto settling biogenic particles and at the seafloor are tuned so that the model replicates the observed pattern of 210 Pb in the oceans. The best-fit model run provides a map of the variability of residence time for Pb. The global average residence time of Pb in this model is 48 yr, but there is over an order of magnitude variation between areas of high and low productivity. This is expected to enhance provinciality of Pb isotope ratios in the oceans. Because stable Pb isotopes are expected to behave in seawater in a similar fashion to 210 Pb, the pattern of removal of 210 Pb derived by the model can be used to investigate the behavior of stable Pb isotopes. We use a simplified input of Pb consisting of five point sources representing major rivers and a disseminated dust input. Although this simplified input scheme does not allow precise reconstruction of Pb concentration and isotopes in the oceans, it allows us to answer some first-order questions about the behavior of Pb as an ocean tracer. With a total Pb input of 6.3 ? 107 mol/yr (Chow T. J. and Patterson C. C., “The occurrence and significance of Pb isotopes in pelagic sediments,” Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 26, 263–308, 1962), the model predicts natural seawater Pb concen- trations averaging 2.2 pmol/kg. Even in the absence of anthropogenic input, the model ocean exhibits a near-surface maximum in Pb concentration. And the model suggests natural Pb concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere an order of magnitude higher than in the Southern Hemisphere. A point source of Pb is suggested to dominate the seawater Pb inventory close to the source but is reduced to typically less than 10{\%} of the inventory by the time that Pb is advected out of the originating ocean. This length scale of advection for Pb isotope signals confirms their potential as tracers of ocean circulation. Assuming an 8{\%} dissolution of dust, their input to the open ocean are seen to be a significant portion of Pb inventory throughout the oceans and make up?50{\%} of the Pb inventory in the model's Southern Ocean. Finally, a preliminary investigation of the response of Pb-isotope distributions to changes in boundary conditions between glacial and interglacial times illustrates that significant variation in the Pb isotopes are expected in some regions, even for reasonably small changes in climate conditions.},

abstract = {ICHTHYOSAURS are extinct marine reptiles, probably belonging to the Diapsida1, that ranged from the Early Triassic to Late Cretaceous2,3. Post-Triassic ichthyosaurs achieved the highest level of aquatic adaptation among reptiles4, with a streamlined body, lunate tail and a dorsal fin, features exemplified today by thunniform (tuna-like) fishes. However, little is known of how such a body plan evolved from a terrestrial diapsid. Here we report the most complete specimen of the oldest known ichthyosaur, Chensaurus, representing a transition between the two body plans. The specimen, which has a partial skin impression, has a small caudal fin, a long and narrow body, and a high presacral vertebral count. These features all suggest an anguilliform swimming mode. Later ichthyosaurs retained the high vertebral count, but overcame the high swimming costs of this plesiomorphy, achieving a rigid tunniform bauplan by evolving discoidal vertebrae, and a deep fusiform body. Chensaurus therefore seems to be an evolutionary intermediate between the shorter-bodied terrestrial stock from which the group evolved, and advanced thunniform ichthyosaurs.},

While the role of the Southern Ocean as a 'control valve' on ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange has been emphasized, the exact nature of this role, in particular the relative contributions of physical (for example, ocean dynamics and air-sea gas exchange) versus biological processes (for example, export productivity), remains poorly constrained. Here we combine reconstructions of bottom-water [O2], export production and (14)C ventilation ages in the sub-Antarctic Atlantic, and show that atmospheric CO2 pulses during the last glacial- and deglacial periods were consistently accompanied by decreases in the biological export of carbon and increases in deep-ocean ventilation via southern-sourced water masses. These findings demonstrate how the Southern Ocean's 'organic carbon pump' has exerted a tight control on atmospheric CO2, and thus global climate, specifically via a synergy of both physical and biological processes.},

About 130 samples were collected in winter 2001 and spring 2002 during Nutrigas and Gasprod campaigns (Programme PNEC-Golfe de Gascogne, RV Thalassa) and metal measurements were conducted on board by Potentiometric Stripping Analysis. In the Loire estuary, levels of dissolved lead ranged from 0.15 to 0.24 nM and from 0.04 to 0.26 nM in winter and spring, respectively. Compared to the concentrations reported in 1987 and 1990 (0.4-1.7 nM; Boutier, B., Chiffoleau, J.F., Auger, D., Truquet, I., 1993. Influence of the Loire river on dissolved lead and cadmium concentrations in coastal waters of Brittany. Estuar. Coast. Shelf S., 36:133-143, Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 36, 133-143) our study indicated much lower values. The fall in concentration in the estuary could be attributed to the stopping of activity of Octel, a big manufacturer of tetra alkyl lead. Discharge in dissolved metal to the continental shelf by the Loire river was assessed as 7.5 and 1.9 kg day- 1 for winter and spring, respectively. On the continental shelf, levels of dissolved lead varied within 0.06 and 0.27 nM in winter (0.15 ± 0.06 nM, sd = 1.96, n = 49), whereas concentrations measured in spring were in the range 0.06-0.17 nM (0.09 ± 0.03 nM, sd = 1.96, n = 60). This difference in metal concentration was related to the amounts of rainfall that have fallen over the continental shelf: estimations of inputs by this way (74 and 32 kg day- 1 in winter and spring, respectively) appeared to be significantly higher than inputs from the Loire river (7.5 and 1.9 kg day- 1 in winter and spring, respectively). The distributions of dissolved metal in the surface waters highlighted the role of suspended particular matter (SPM) for a rapid "trapping" of lead near the mouth of the estuary. The vertical distributions showed, in the stratified area, a biological transfer of lead between winter and spring from surface waters to the halocline. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the concentration changes of Li, Na, K, Mg, Cl, SO4, and B during evaporation of both natural Uyuni and artificial Atacama brines. The Uyuni brine exhibited a maximum Li concentration of 6810 mg L−1 at 31 days of evaporation, at which point the majority of the Na and K in the brine was removed. The Li concentration decreased with further evaporation due to precipitation as Li2SO4, such that the level at the 56 day mark was approximately 4130 mg L−1. In contrast, the artificial Atacama brine showed no pronounced Li precipitation, even after 54 days, at which point the Li concentration was 21,800 mg L−1. The initial concentrations of Na and K in the Atacama brine were higher than those in the Uyuni brine, and the Atacama solution still retained K after 54 days of evaporation. The order of precipitation of cation species during the evaporation of both brines was: Na, followed by K, Mg, and Li. Thus, Li precipitation in the Atacama brine might be prevented due to the more favored precipitations of Na and K, such that significant Li removal did not occur in this brine.},

abstract = {The most common classification of modes of speciation begins with the spatial context in which divergence occurs: sympatric, parapatric or allopatric. This classification is unsatisfactory because it divides a continuum into discrete categories, concentrating attention on the extremes, and it subordinates other dimensions on which speciation processes vary, such as the forces driving differentiation and the genetic basis of reproductive isolation. It also ignores the fact that speciation is a prolonged process that commonly has phases in different spatial contexts. We use the example of local adaptation and partial reproductive isolation in the intertidal gastropod Littorina saxatilis to illustrate the inadequacy of the spatial classification of speciation modes. Parallel divergence in shell form in response to similar environmental gradients in England, Spain and Sweden makes this an excellent model system. However, attempts to demonstrate 'incipient' and 'sympatric' speciation involve speculation about the future and the past. We suggest that it is more productive to study the current balance between local adaptation and gene flow, the interaction between components of reproductive isolation and the genetic basis of differentiation.},

Accurate assessment of the latter relies on well-constrained historical and modern lead fluxes from proxy records and direct observations, lead source estimates from stable lead isotopes, and transport rate estimates from radionuclides. Numerous studies support the global-scale atmospheric lead fluxes principally derived from anthropogenic activities, the short lead residence time in the atmosphere and surface ocean, and the predominance of North American and European lead emissions. Emerging observations and models are currently addressing the time-dependent evolution of this reactive tracer in the atmosphere and oceans.},

This approach should allow us to obtain new insights on weathering conditions in different environments and assess the influence of human activities on natural geochemical cycles. Finally, this study demonstrates the large uncertainties currently associated with estimating the flux of sediments transported by rivers. By comparing the riverine suspended sediment fluxes of some metals (Cd, Zn, Ni, Cu, Cr and Pb) given in this study with estimates of the anthropogenic fluxes of these metals to the atmosphere, soils and waters (natural ecosystems) [Nriagu, J.O., 1988. A silent epidemic of environmental poisoning. Environ. Pollut. 50, 139-161.], we can see that riverine fluxes are similar to anthropogenic fluxes. This casts light on the effect of human activities on the cycles of trace elements at the Earth's surface. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The tropics are the main source of the atmosphere's sensible and latent heat, and water vapour, and are therefore important for reconstructions of past climate. But long, accurately dated records of southern tropical palaeoclimate, which would allow the establishment of climatic connections to distant regions, have not been available. Here we present a 210,000-year (210-kyr) record of wet periods in tropical northeastern Brazil--a region that is currently semi-arid. The record is obtained from speleothems and travertine deposits that are accurately dated using the U/Th method. We find wet periods that are synchronous with periods of weak East Asian summer monsoons, cold periods in Greenland, Heinrich events in the North Atlantic and periods of decreased river runoff to the Cariaco basin. We infer that the wet periods may be explained with a southward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. This widespread synchroneity of climate anomalies suggests a relatively rapid global reorganization of the ocean-atmosphere system. We conclude that the wet periods probably affected rainforest distribution, as plant fossils show that forest expansion occurred during these intermittent wet intervals, and opened a forest corridor between the Amazonian and Atlantic rainforests.},

abstract = {Spatial correlation modeling comprises both spatial autocorrelation and spatial cross-correlation processes. The spatial autocorrelation theory has been well-developed. It is necessary to advance the method of spatial cross-correlation analysis to supplement the autocorrelation analysis. This paper presents a set of models and analytical procedures for spatial cross-correlation analysis. By analogy with Moran's index newly expressed in a spatial quadratic form, a theoretical framework is derived for geographical cross-correlation modeling. First, two sets of spatial cross-correlation coefficients are defined, including a global spatial cross-correlation coefficient and local spatial cross-correlation coefficients. Second, a pair of scatterplots of spatial cross-correlation is proposed, and the plots can be used to visually reveal the causality behind spatial systems. Based on the global cross-correlation coefficient, Pearson's correlation coefficient can be decomposed into two parts: direct correlation (partial correlation) and indirect correlation (spatial cross-correlation). As an example, the methodology is applied to the relationships between China's urbanization and economic development to illustrate how to model spatial cross-correlation phenomena. This study is an introduction to developing the theory of spatial cross-correlation, and future geographical spatial analysis might benefit from these models and indexes.},

abstract = {Dissolved 210Pb profiles are presented for 13 GEOSECS stations in the western Indian Ocean. In surface water away from high southern latitudes, 210Pb is in excess over 226Ra due to the atmospheric fallout from decay of 222Rn. Except in the Circumpolar region, the dissolved 210Pb profiles display a gentle mid-depth maximum similar to the corresponding 226Ra profiles. The 210Pb226Ra activity ratio ranges from 1.6 in the surface water east of Madagascar to 0.4 or less in the bottom water of all the basins. The lowest ratio observed was 0.1 in the Gulf of Aden very close to the continental land mass. A ratio of 0.6 divides the western Indian Ocean horizontally into two portions, with the contour at shallower depth in the north than in the south. The deep water disequilibrium is thus more extensive north of Madagascar than south of it. It appears that locality and bottom topography play a strong role in controlling the distributions of 210Pb and 226Ra as well as their extent of disequilibrium in the water column. The mean residence time for Pb with respect to particulate and boundary scavenging in the deep water ranges from about 15 to 75 years. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {As a physical phenomenon, earthquakes must be predictable to a certain degree. However, the problem is difficult, because the source volume inside the earth is inaccessible to direct observation and because the most important parameter, the stress level, cannot be measured directly. Also, seismology is such a young science that the cause of earthquakes was discovered in the 1960s only. Advanced seismograph networks as well as modern techniques to measure crustal deformations, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry technique (InSAR), have come on line only recently, and only in Japan are they deployed with the densities necessary for significant advances in the understanding of the rupture initiation process. In addition, no real program for earthquake prediction research exists in the United States, largely because funding agencies and peer reviewers shy away from a field in which unprofessional, but motivated individuals are active. Although claims of successful predictions are often not justified, a few correct predictions have been made. Most of these had time-windows of years, but some were accurate to days and allowed preparatory actions. To make significant progress, we must learn how to conduct rigorous science in a field where amateurs cannot be discouraged to venture. Leadership is necessary to raise the funding to an adequate level and to involve the best minds in this promising, potentially extremely rewarding, but controversial research topic. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Slow (aseismic) slip that accommodates part of the long-term plate motion on subduction megathrusts is thought to be strongly related to the occurrence of large earthquakes on the same fault zone. However, the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of the aseismic slip before major earthquakes and of accelerated postseismic afterslip are largely unconstrained. We estimate cumulative offsets of small repeating earthquakes that are interpreted to reflect the in situ aseismic slip history on the subduction zone offshore northeastern Japan. These data reveal contrasting aseismic slip patterns between the coseismic rupture area of the Mw 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake and surrounding portions of the subduction thrust. The rupture area is characterised by low and variable slip rates before 2008, and the slip stopped almost completely after the earthquake. The region surrounding the rupture area exhibited higher aseismic fault slip rates before the earthquake and clear postseismic slip of up to 1.6. m within 9 months following the main shock. The frictional fault properties and complete relief of ambient stress in the central rupture zone of the main shock probably control the observed distribution. The postseismic slip shows a more abrupt increase in the region closer to the source, suggesting outwards propagation of afterslip. Small but distinct increases in the slip rate in the {\~{}}3. yr before the earthquake near the area of large coseismic slip suggests preseismic unfastening of the locked area in the last stage of the earthquake cycle. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In 1988, areal distributions clearly identified the Po, Adige and Brenta rivers as the main sources of contaminants. The study area was divided in three compartments. The area in front of the Po delta represented a sink for metals but the accumulation of Zn and Pb integrated over the entire study area suggests an effective export throughout southern boundary.

Very high Ba contents had been previously observed only in the late Variscan mineralization of the “Quartzite” horizon. This horizon is located between the Gonnesa and the Portixeddu Fms, in a reduced sequence due to the complete erosion of the Cabitza and Monte Argentu Fms. High Ba contents, with six values exceeding 1000 ppm, up to 4363 ppm, indicate that even in its early tectonic movements, before the Late Variscan mineralizing event, the SU acted as a major pathway for the circulation of Ba-rich fluids. Ba contents significantly decrease with the distance from the SU, with local maxima in correspondence of more heterogeneous and frequent permeable layers.},

abstract = {Lead has no biological function and is one of the most toxic metals. At the same time, it is one of the most useful, and perhaps no other metal has found such a wide range of industrial applications. It has been used extensively since Antiquity, which is when environmental Pb contamination began. With respect to contamination since industrialization, peat bogs and polar ice show that coal combustion and industrial emissions were as important during the first half of the 20th century as gasoline lead was during the second half. Air Pb concentrations have generally declined since the introduction of pollution control technologies and the gradual elimination of leaded gasoline additives. However, all of the most recent published studies of the isotopic composition of Pb in aerosols and archival samples show that anthropogenic sources continue to dominate the atmospheric Pb flux by a considerable margin. The health effects of childhood Pb exposure is a growing concern, as deleterious effects are seen at BLL well below those currently believed to be safe, and safe levels are one or two orders of magnitude above the estimated natural values. Mobilization of Pb-rich particles from highly contaminated soils in urban areas is an on-going health concern for many large cities. Even in areas far removed from industrial emission sources, Pb concentrations in the surface soil layers are far above their natural concentration range. In acidic forest soils, Pb concentrations are not only elevated in the biologically active zone, but also in their corresponding pore fluids. Accurate and precise measurements of the isotopic composition of Pb employing appropriate clean lab protocols, will continue to advance our understanding of the fate of Pb in the environment and its impact on human and ecosystem health.},

However, slow earthquakes and huge megathrust earthquakes can have common slip mechanisms and are located in neighboring regions of the seismogenic zone. The frequent occurrence of slow earthquakes may help to reveal the physics underlying megathrust events as useful analogs. Slow earthquakes may function as stress meters because of their high sensitivity to stress changes in the seismogenic zone. Episodic stress transfer to megathrust source faults leads to an increased probability of triggering huge earthquakes if the adjacent locked region is critically loaded. Careful and precise monitoring of slow earthquakes may provide new information on the likelihood of impending huge earthquakes.},

The atmospheric mercury was collected on a porous gold collector at Kagoshima University and was determined by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry; Kagoshima University of Kagoshima City is located approximately 11 km west of Sakurajima Volcano. The mercury concentration obtained was in the range 1.2-52.5 ng m-3 (mean 10.8 ng m-3, n = 169). The atmospheric concentration varied from season to season; the concentration was high in summer and lower in winter. A linear relation was obtained by plotting ln [Hg/ng m-3] vs. 1/T for the north, south and west winds with correlation coefficients of -0.76, -0.79 and -0.83, respectively, but no such dependency was found for the east wind (r = - 0.035). When the wind is blowing from the east, Kagoshima City is on the leeward side of the volcano. The impact of the fumarolic activity of the volcano on ambient air in the city was evident in the disappearance of temperature dependency with the appearance of the east wind.

abstract = {Modern technology allows real-time seismic monitoring facilities to evolve into earthquake early warning (EEW) systems, capable of reducing deaths, injuries, and economic losses, as well as of speeding up rescue response and damage recovery. The objective of an EEW system is to estimate in a fast and reliable way the earthquake's damage potential, before the strong shaking hits a given target. The necessary framework for EEW implementation is provided by the observed relationships between different parameters measured on the signal onsets and the final earthquake size. The implication of these observations on the physics of fracture processes has given rise to a significant debate in the seismological community. Currently, EEW systems are implemented or under testing in many countries of the world, and different methodologies and procedures have been studied and developed. The leading experience of countries like Japan or Mexico shows that, with a proper education of population and end-users, and with the design of real-time systems for the reduction of vulnerability/exposure, EEW can be an effective approach to the mitigation of the seismic risk at short time-scales. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Concentrations of dissolved trace elements (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and As) were determined over a 4-year period (1987 –91) during contrasting hydrological conditions in a typically stratified system: the Rh {\^{o}}ne river estuary. Dissolved concentrations in the river water vary by nearly one order of magnitude. Estimated average values (nM) are: As, 26; Cd, 0 {\textperiodcentered}27; Cu, 35; Ni, 27; and Pb, 0 {\textperiodcentered}42. They indicate some degree of contamination for Cd, Ni and Pb, as compared to levels in pristine rivers and world averages. Dissolved concentration variations were interpreted in terms of a dilution of two sources of trace metals, i.e. anthropogenic discharges and leaching of surface soils. Concentrations in the river suspended matter (Cd, Cu, Ni and Pb) were measured during one survey (July 1987); comparison with published data also seems to indicate variable inputs to the estuarine zone. The distributions of As, Cu, Ni and Pb are conservative in the Rh {\^{o}}ne mixing zone, whereas a small excess is sometimes observed for dissolved Cd. On the whole, trace metal concentrations in the suspended matter tend to decrease from the mixing zone to the open sea. They are only weakly controlled by the amount of terrigenous alumino-silicates. A sorption experiment shows that Cd fixation on the suspended matter is enhanced by increased amounts of particulate organic matter. The simultaneous use ofin situandin vitrodistribution coefficients allows an estimation of the partitioning of particulate Cd between the reactive and non-reactive fractions of the suspended matter. This approach would confirm the mobilization of labile Cd in the saline surface plume.},

abstract = {Ferromanganese oxide concretions from the Indian Ocean exhibit considerable mineralogical and chemical variation, often differentiated on a regional basis. Nodules richest in Mn, Ni, Cu and Zn are found in sub-equatorial basin areas, but enrichments of some of these metals also occur in nodules elsewhere, particularly where there is evidence of major biogenic contributions to their underlying sediments. Fe, CO and Pb are most enriched in concretions from sea-mounts and the mid-ocean ridge system, but also attain high values in some basin areas. Local variations in concretion composition have been found off southern Africa, and are due to both biological and continental influences. There are several major controls on the compositions of the concretions. Source variations influence composition in that Mn, Ni and Cu show evidence of diagenetic enrichment in deposits after being cycled through the biogenic component of sediments, whereas, Fe, CO and Pb appear to be supplied mainly by normal seawater. Environmental influences, including bottom water characteristics, affect the degree of dissolution of biogenic remains and this affects the sediment type and the supply of metals to the deposits and also their mineralogy, which in turn affects trace metal uptake. In the Central Indian Basin, source and environmental influences combine to produce ‘ore grade' nodules.},

Lithium extraction from primary resources such as ores/minerals (spodumene, petalite and lepidolite) by acid, alkaline and chlorination processes and from brines by adsorption, precipitation and ion exchange processes, is critically examined. Problems associated with the exploitation of other resources such as bitterns and seawater are highlighted. As regards the secondary resources, the industrial processes followed and the newer developments aiming at the recovery of lithium from lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are described in detail. In particular pre-treatment of the spent LIBs, leaching of metals from the cathode material in different acids and separation of lithium and other metals from the leach liquors, are discussed. Although spent LIBs are currently processed to recover cobalt and other base metals but not lithium, there is a good prospect for the recovery of lithium in the coming years. Varying compositions of batteries for different applications require development of a suitable recycling process to recover metals from all types of LIBs.},

Survey I occurred in February/March with moderate El Nino conditions while Survey II was conducted in September/October when there was a well developed cold-tongue. 234Th, 210Pb and 210Po are all particle reactive yet they partition differently between dissolved and particulate phases. Fractionation factors (the ratios of the distribution coefficients) show that the selectivity for suspended and sediment trap particles follows Th{\textgreater}Po{\textgreater}Pb. Scavenging residence times (??) for 234Th, 210Pb and 210Po ranged from 25 to 100 d, 3 to 8 years and 100 to 500 d, respectively. These particle reactive tracers have very different distributions in the water column, which reflect differences in their sources and sinks. The deficiency of 234Th relative to 238U was fairly uniformly distributed meridionally, though deficiencies were higher during Survey II when there was higher new production. Excess 210Pb relative to 226Ra was very asymmetrical with much higher excess values north of the equator. The distributions were similar for Surveys I and II. The deficiency of 210Po relative to 210Pb had a symmetrical distribution about the equator for both Survey I and II but the deficiencies were larger during Survey I when upwelling was smaller. Stable Pb was generally higher at the surface than at 250 m and there was no meridional trend from 12??N to 12??S. A mass balance for 210Pb was used to determine the atmospheric input of 210Pb. The average values for Surveys I and II were 0.12 and 0.32 dpm cm-2 year-1, respectively. There was no general increase in atmospheric input of 210Pb north of the equator but there was a strong maximum at 2-3??N during Survey I coincident with the location of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), suggesting a large role for wet deposition. A mass balance for stable Pb was used to determine the atmospheric input of stable Pb. Results ranged from 110 to 140 pmol cm-2 year-1. This flux was low in the southern hemisphere and increased steadily north of the equator. We evaluated use of 210Po as a tracer for export of particulate organic matter during Survey I. Organic carbon and 210Po were highly correlated in suspended matter and sediment trap samples. Average values of organic carbon fluxes determined from the deficiencies of 210Po times the orgC/210Po ratio agreed well with those determined from the deficiencies of 234Th times the organic carbon/234Th ratio and 15N-new production, but had a much larger variability because of the more variable advection corrections. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent trends of atmospheric lead deposition to the North Pacific were investigated with analyses of lead in aerosols and surface waters collected on the fourth Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Contaminant Baseline Survey from May to June, 2002. Lead concentrations of the aerosols varied by 2 orders of magnitude (0.1-26.4 pmol/m(3)) due in part to variations in dust deposition during the cruise. The ranges in lead aerosol enrichment factors relative to iron (1-119) and aluminum (3-168) were similar, evidencing the transport of Asian industrial lead aerosols across the North Pacific. The oceanic deposition of some of those aerosols was substantiated by the gradient of lead concentrations of North Pacific waters, which varied 3-fold (32.7-103.5 pmol/kg), were highest along with the Asian margin of the basin, and decreased eastward. The hypothesized predominance of Asian industrial lead inputs to the North Pacific was further corroborated by the lead isotopic composition of ocean surface waters ((206)Pb/(207)Pb = 1.157-1.169; (208)Pb/(206)Pb = 2.093-2.118), which fell within the range of isotopic ratios reported in Asian aerosols that are primarily attributed to Chinese industrial lead emissions.},

abstract = {Due to the major role played by diatoms in the biological pump of CO2, and to the presence of silica-rich sediments in areas that play a major role in air-sea CO2 exchange (e.g. the Southern Ocean and the Equatorial Pacific), opal has a strong potential as a proxy for paleoproductivity reconstructions. However, because of spatial variations in the biogenic silica preservation, and in the degree of coupling between the marine Si and C biogeochemical cycles, paleoreconstructions are not straitghtforward. A better calibration of this proxy in the modern ocean is required, which needs a good understanding of the mechanisms that control the Si cycle, in close relation to the carbon cycle. This review of the Si cycle in the modern ocean starts with the mechanisms that control the uptake of silicic acid (Si(OH)4) by diatoms and the subsequent silicification processes, the regulatory mechanisms of which are uncoupled. This has strong implications for the direct measurement in the field of the kinetics of Si(OH)4 uptake and diatom growth. It also strongly influences the Si:C ratio within diatoms, clearly linked to environmental conditions. Diatoms tend to dominate new production at marine ergoclines. At depth, they also succeed to form mats, which sedimentation is at the origin of laminated sediments and marine sapropels. The concentration of Si(OH)4 with respect to other macronutrients exerts a major influence on diatom dominance and on the rain ratio between siliceous and calcareous material, which severely impacts surface waters pCO2. A compilation of biogenic fluxes collected at about 40 sites by means of sediment traps also shows a remarkable pattern of increasing BSi:Corg ratio along the path of the "conveyor belt", accompanying the relative enrichment of waters in Si compared to N and P. This observation suggests an extension of the Si pump model described by Dugdale and Wilkerson (Dugdale, R.C., Wilkerson, F.P., 1998. Understanding the eastern equatorial Pacific as a continuous new production system regulating on silicate. Nature 391, 270-273.), giving to Si(OH)4 a major role in the control of the rain ratio, which is of major importance in the global carbon cycle. The fate of the BSi produced in surface waters is then described, in relation to Corg, in terms of both dissolution and preservation mechanisms. Difficulties in quantifying the dissolution of biogenic silica in the water column as well as the sinking rates and forms of BSi to the deep, provide evidence for a major gap in our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the competition between retention in and export from surface waters. The relative influences of environmental conditions, seasonality, food web structure or aggregation are however explored. Quantitatively, assuming steady state, the measurements of the opal rain rate by means of sediment traps matches reasonably well those obtained by adding the recycling and burial fluxes in the underlying abyssal sediments, for most of the sites where such a comparison is possible. The major exception is the Southern Ocean where sediment focusing precludes the closing of mass balances. Focusing in fact is also an important aspect of the downward revision of the importance of Southern Ocean sediments in the global biogenic silica accumulation. Qualitatively, little is known about the duration of the transfer through the deep and the quality of the material that reaches the seabed, which is suggested to represent a major gap in our understanding of the processes governing the early diagenesis of BSi in sediments. The sediment composition (special emphasis on A1 availability), the sedimentation rate or bioturbation are shown to exert an important control on the competition between dissolution and preservation of BSi in sediments. It is suggested that a primary control on the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of BSi dissolution, both in coastal and abyssal sediments, is exerted by water column processes, either occuring in surface waters during the formation of the frustules, or linked to the transfer of the particles through the water column, which duration may influence the quality of the biogenic rain. This highlights the importance of studying the factors controlling the degree of coupling between pelagic and benthic processes in various regions of the world ocean, and its consequences, not only in terms of benthic biology but also for the constitution of the sediment archive. The last section, first calls for the end of the "NPZD" models, and for the introduction of processes linked to the Si cycle, into models describing the phytoplankton cycles in surface waters and the early diagenesis of BSi in sediments. It also calls for the creation of an integrated 1-D diagnostic model of the Si:C coupling, for a better understanding of the interactions between surface waters, deep waters and the upper sedimentary column. The importance of Si(OH)4 in the control of the rain ratio and the improved parametrization of the Si cycle in the 1-D diagnostic models should lead to a reasonable incorporation of the Si cycle into 3-D regional circulation models and OGCMs, with important implications for climate change studies and paleoreconstructions at regional and global scale. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Four vertical 210Pb profiles obtained within 250 m above bottom in the deep western North Pacific showed no significant variation with depth, irrespective of marked increase of excess 222Rn relative to 226Ra near the seafloor. Consequently, the apparent box-model residence time based on 210Pb/222Rn activity ratio sharply decreases from ??? 100 years in ocean interior to {\textless} 10 years near the bottom. However, the 210Pb data can also be explained using a vertical mixing and first-order scavenging model without any enhanced scavenging near the sediment-water interface. This model calculation indicates that bottom excess 222Rn can hardly influence 210Pb in the water and the short residence time derived using box-model is an artifact and does not reflect chemical reactivity of Pb. This also implies that the deficiency of 210Pb as a result of removal by scavenging is best estimated based on 226Ra and not on 222Rn. The 210Pb scavenging at the sediment-water interface that has been inferred from the oceanic distributions of 210Pb appears difficult to be detected from bottom 210Pb profile measurements. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {Major advances in analytical chemistry and instrumentation have prompted major advances in our understanding of trace metal biogeochemistry. However, the deep-water concentration of most trace elements has not been yet assessed across broad regions of the oceans. A synthesis of data on trace metals (i.e. Cd, Co, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb and Zn) measured and reported for depths 1000m or deeper, between 1976 and 2009 revealed major gaps in our coverage of this key property. Cadmium and Cu have been the elements more extensively measured with 264 and 210 deep profiles reported in 64 and 57 articles, respectively, while Mo and Co have been reported only at 17 and 60 ocean sites, respectively. Globally 68.1{\%} (216.1 10 6km 2) of deep oceans (1000m or deeper) have not been sampled. The bulk of depth profiles published in peer reviewed scientific literature are from the Northern hemisphere (69.7{\%} of the total reported profiles) rendering the Southern hemisphere as a poorly explored region for these important properties (mainly in the South and Eastern Pacific Ocean and in the Tropical Indian Ocean). Vertical profiles of dissolved elements plotted with data compiled during the last 34years indicate that, in addition to the variation of concentrations, vertical distributions differs per ocean basin. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {The 2011 Tohoku earthquake is another striking example - after the 2008 Wenchuan and 2010 Haiti earthquakes - of highly destructive earthquakes that occurred in areas predicted by earthquake hazard maps to be relatively safe. Here, we examine what went wrong for Tohoku, and how this failure illustrates limitations of earthquake hazard mapping. We use examples from several seismic regions to show that earthquake occurrence is typically more complicated than the models on which hazard maps are based, and that the available history of seismicity is almost always too short to reliably establish the spatiotemporal pattern of large earthquake occurrence. As a result, key aspects of hazard maps often depend on poorly constrained parameters, whose values are chosen based on the mapmakers' preconceptions. When these are incorrect, maps do poorly. This situation will improve at best slowly, owing to our limited understanding of earthquake processes. However, because hazard mapping has become widely accepted and used to make major decisions, we suggest two changes to improve current practices. First, the uncertainties in hazard map predictions should be assessed and clearly communicated to potential users. Recognizing the uncertainties would enable users to decide how much credence to place in the maps and make them more useful in formulating cost-effective hazard mitigation policies. Second, hazard maps should undergo rigorous and objective testing to compare their predictions to those of null hypotheses, including ones based on uniform regional seismicity or hazard. Such testing, which is common and useful in similar fields, will show how well maps actually work and hopefully help produce measurable improvements. There are likely, however, limits on how well hazard maps can ever be made because of the intrinsic variability of earthquake processes. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {International aid is increasingly focused on adaptation to climate change. At recent meetings of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the developed world agreed to rapidly increase international assistance to help the developing world respond to the impacts of climate change. In this paper, we examine the decision-making challenges facing internationally supported climate change adaptation projects, using the example of efforts to implement coastal protection measures (e.g. sea walls, mangrove planting) in Kiribati. The central equatorial Pacific country is home to the Kiribati Adaptation Project, the first national-level climate change adaptation project supported by the World Bank. Drawing on interview and document research conducted over an 8-year period, we trace the forces influencing decisions about coastal protection measures, starting from the variability and uncertainty in climate change projections, through the trade-offs between different measures, to the social, political, and economic context in which decisions are finally made. We then discuss how sub-optimal adaptation measures may be implemented despite years of planning, consultation, and technical studies. This qualitative analysis of the real-world process of climate change adaptation reveals that embracing a culturally appropriate and short-term ({\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}20 years) planning horizon, while not ignoring the longer-term future, may reduce the influence of scientific uncertainty on decisions and provide opportunities to learn from mistakes, reassess the science, and adjust suboptimal investments. The limiting element in this approach to adaptation is likely to be the availability of consistent, long-term financing.},
